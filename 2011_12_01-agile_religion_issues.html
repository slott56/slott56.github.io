Development</a> and
this <a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2011_10_20-the_agile_religion_what.html">The Agile &quot;Religion&quot; --
What?</a>.</p>
<p>What's important is that the limitations of Agile are not
limitations.  They're (mostly) intentional roadblocks to Agile.</p>
<p>Looking for &quot;limitations&quot; in the Agile approach misses the point of
Agile in several important ways.</p>
<p>The most important problem with this list of &quot;limitations&quot; is that
five of the six issues are simply anti-Agile positions that a company
can take.</p>
<p>In addition to being anti-Agile, a company can be anti-Test Driven
Development.  They can be Anti-Continuous Integration.  They can be
Anti-NoSQL.  There are lots of steps a company can take to subvert any
given development practice.  Taking a step against a practice does not
reveal a limitation.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;1. A team of stars... it takes more than the average Joe to achieve agility&quot;</strong>.   This is not a specific step against agility.  I chalk
this up to a project manager who really likes autocratic rule.  It's
also possible that this is from a project manager that's deeply
misanthropic.  Either way, the underlying assumption is that
developers are somehow too dumb or disorganized to be trusted.</p>
<p>Agile only requires working toward a common goal.  I can't see how a
project manager is an <em>essential</em> feature of working toward a common
goal.  A manager may make things more clear or more efficient, but
that's all.  Indeed, the &quot;clarity&quot; issue is emphasized in most Agile
methods: a &quot;Scrum Master&quot; is part of the team specifically to foster
clarity of purpose.</p>
<p>Further, some Agile methods require a Product Owner to clarify the
team's direction.</p>
<p>&quot;A team of stars&quot; is emphatically <strong>not</strong> required.  The experience of
folks working in Agile environments confirms this.  Real, working
Agile teams really really are average.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;2. Fit with organizational culture&quot;</strong>.  This has nothing to do with
Agile methods.  This is just a sweeping (and true) generalization
about organizations.  An organization that refuses autonomy and
refuses flexibility can't use Agile methods.  An organization that
refuses to create a &quot;Big Design Up Front&quot; can't use a traditional
waterfall method and <strong>must</strong> use Agile methods.</p>
<p>Organizational fit is not a limitation of Agile.  It's just a fact
about people.</p>
<div class="section" id="small-team-assuming-that-large-projects-tend-to-require-large-teams-this-restriction-naturally-extends-to-project-size">
<h2>&quot;3. Small team...Assuming that large projects tend to require large teams, this restriction naturally extends to project size.&quot;</h2>
<p>The assumption simply contradicts Agile principles.  It's not a
&quot;limitation&quot; at all.  Large projects (with large numbers of people)
have a number of smaller teams.  I've seen projects with over a dozen
parallel Agile teams.  This means that in addition to a dozen daily
scrums, there's also a scrum-of-scrums by the scrum masters.</p>
<p>Throwing out the small team isn't a limitation of Agile.  It's a
failure to understand Agile.  A project with many small teams works
quite well.  It's not &quot;religion&quot;.  It's experience.</p>
<p>A single large team has been shown (for the last few decades) to be
expensive and risky.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;4. Collocated team...We can easily think of a number of situations where this limitation prevents using agile:&quot;</strong>  These are not
limitations of Agile, but outright refusals to follow Agile
principles.  Specifically:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;<strong>Office space organized by departments</strong>&quot; is not a limitation of
Agile.  That's a symptom of an organization that refuses to be Agile.
See #2 above; this indicates a bad fit with the culture.  An
organization that doesn't have space organized by department might
have trouble executing a traditional waterfall method.</li>
<li>&quot;<strong>Distributed environment</strong>&quot; is not a limitation of Agile.  Phones
work.  Skype works.</li>
<li>&quot;<strong>Subcontracting... We have to acknowledge that there is no
substitute for face-to-face</strong>&quot;.  Actually, subcontracting is
irrelevant.  Further, subcontracting is not a synonym for a failure
to be collocated.  When subcontractors are located remotely, phones
still work.  Skype works better and is cheaper.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&quot;5. Where’s my methodology?&quot;</strong>  This is hard to sort out, since
it's full of errors.  Essentially, this appears to be a claim that a
well-defined, documented processes is somehow <em>essential</em> to software
development.  Experience over the last few decades is quite clear
that the written processes and the work actually performed diverge a
great deal.  Most of the time, what people do is not documented, and
the documented process has no bearing on what people actually do.  A
documented process -- in most cases -- appears irrelevant to the work
actually done.</p>
<p>Agile is not chaos.  It's a change in the rules to de-emphasize
unthinking adherence to a plan and replace this with focus on working
software.  Well-organized software analysis, design, code and test
still exist even without elaborately documented (and irrelevant)
process definitions.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>6. Team ownership vs. individual accountability... how can we implement it since an organization’s performance-reward system assesses individual performance and rewards individuals, not teams...?</strong>&quot;
Again, the assumption (&quot;performance-reward system
assesses individual performance&quot;) is simply a rejection of Agile
principles.  It's not a limitation of Agile, it's an intentional step
away from an Agile approach.</p>
<p>If an organization insists on individual performance metrics, see #2.
The culture is simply antithetical to Agile. Agile still works; the
organization, however, is taking active steps to subvert it.</p>
<p>Agile isn't a religion.  It doesn't suffer from hidden or ignored
&quot;limitations&quot;.</p>

<div class="section" id="but-did-we-question-the-assumption-that-agile-was-indeed-superior-to-traditional-methodologies">
<h2>&quot;But did we question the assumption that Agile was indeed superior to traditional methodologies?&quot;</h2>
<p>The answer is &quot;yes&quot;.  A thousand times yes.  The whole reason for
Agile approaches is specifically and entirely because of folks
questioning traditional methodologies.  Traditional
command-and-control methodologies have a long history of not working
out well for software development.  The Agile Manifesto is a result
of examining the failures of traditional methods.</p>
<p>A traditional &quot;waterfall&quot; methodology works when there are few
unknowns.  Construction projects, for example, rarely have the kinds
of unknowns that software development has.  Construction usually
involves well-known techniques applied to well-documented plans to
produce a well-understood result.  Software development rarely
involves so many well-known details.  Software development is 80%
design and 20% construction.  And the design part involves 80%
learning something new and 20% applying experience.</p>
<p>Agile is not Snake Oil.  It's not something to be taken on faith.</p>
<p>The Agile community exists for exactly one reason.  Agile methods
work.</p>
<p>Agile isn't a money-making product or service offering.  Agile --
itself -- is free.  Some folks try to leverage Agile techniques to
sell supporting products or services, but Agile isn't an IBM or
Oracle product.  There are no &quot;backers&quot;.  There's no trail of money
to see who profits from Agility.</p>
<p>Folks have been questioning &quot;traditional&quot; methodologies for years.
Why?  Because &quot;traditional&quot; waterfall methodologies are a
crap-shoot.  Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't work.  The
essential features of long term success are summarized in the <a class="reference external" href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile
Manifesto</a>.  Well-run projects all
seem to have certain common features; the features of well-run
projects form the basis for the Agile methods.</p>

<p>&gt;(mostly) intentional roadblock
Personally I prefer words like &quot;administering the are you serious test&quot;?
Recently, a client was jumping up and down that they wanted x. I
requested that they do x to further their goal. It took them over 6 days
to do x. When I pointed this out they were furious were furious but they
go the point.</p>

<p>Hi, probably our entry may be off topic but anyways, I have been surfing
around your blog and it looks
very professional. It’s obvious you know your topic and you appear
fervent about it. I’m developing a
fresh blog plus I’m struggling to make it look good, as well as offer
the best quality content. I have
learned much at your web site and also I anticipate alot more articles
and will be coming back soon.
Thanks you.
