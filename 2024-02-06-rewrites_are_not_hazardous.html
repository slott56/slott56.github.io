                <p>First, read this: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/rewrites-hazardous/">Hazards And Safeguards for Software Rewrites</a>.
This is an infuriating article. The first part is nonsense. I wonder if it's intended to be read ironically?
Maybe it's a list of bad ideas?
Skip straight to the <strong>Safeguards for Rewrites</strong> section. It's really good.</p>
<p>Also, this <a class="reference external" href="https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/characterization-testing-in-nuclear-power-and-software/">Characterization Testing in Nuclear Power and Software</a>.
This is really good. I used to call it &quot;Test-Driven Reverse Engineering.&quot; It's how you manage a rewrite.
Can endorse as a risk mitigation strategy for everyone who has legacy code.</p>
<div class="section" id="bluf">
<h2>BLUF</h2>
<p>Rewrites are not hazardous. Ignore the &quot;hazards&quot; part of the article.
This part is infuriatingly full of talking points that make precious little sense.</p>
<p>It's <strong>managing</strong> the rewrite that can become hazardous when managers utterly fail to acknowledge the accrued costs and risks of legacy software.</p>
<p>Ignore the first part of the article. Skip to the <strong>Safeguards for Rewrites</strong> section.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hazards-really">
<h2>Hazards? Really?</h2>
<p>The article leads with four issues.
It's not clear if this is intended as a list of bad arguments against a rewrite or simply ironically wrong statements.</p>
<p>It says &quot;Here are typical issues you’ll encounter:&quot; as if these are real hazards.
I think these are nonsense things commonly stated as arguments to avoid or prevent a rewrite.
I think -- maybe -- these are issues people raise to avoid talking rationally about a rewrite.</p>
<p>This is what's infuriating about the article. The second half is really good. The first half is hard to interpret.</p>
<p>My working concept is the first half is &quot;farcical hazard statements&quot; not real hazards.</p>
<p>If I read these are specious, bad rationale for <strong>Business as Usual</strong> and <strong>Keep The Lights On</strong>, then,
it makes a little sense.
I've added refutations here, because the original article doesn't directly refute them, it just states them as if they're real hazards.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">&quot;100% feature matching is difficult.&quot; It's actually quite easy. Read the companion piece. Skip to the <strong>Safegaurds</strong> section.
It's also undesirable. As noted later in the article, this should never have been a goal.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">&quot;You risk building the new system as poorly as the old system.&quot; This is only true if you have the same inept management and insane budgeting as the original.
You'd also need to have the same language, frameworks, and lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>Let me emphasize this last point: <strong>lack of knowledge.</strong>  The team writing the legacy code was feeling their way along in the
dark. That's emphatically no longer true. The legacy system lights the path.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">&quot;It’s easy to underestimate the effort.&quot; This is always true. It's particularly true when management ignores
the dollars poured into maintenance and support. More than once, I've been told that some 10-year-old spaghetti-bowl
of legacy code was written by 4 people in 13 weeks. Somehow, the ensuing 10 years vanished.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">&quot;Tension may build between the rewrite team and the support team.&quot;
I don't see much refutation, perhaps another article?
I've encountered this, and seen people resign rather than be involved in replacing code they've spent their entire career maintaining.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's go on. There's more to the hazards section.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="more-hazards">
<h2>More Hazards</h2>
<p>Again, the following hazards are mostly bunk. Let's assume they're actually bad arguments against a rewrite.
The article doesn't refute these in detail, instead it skips on to the <strong>Safeguards for Rewrites</strong> section.
I feel the need to refute them in detail.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">&quot;If you miss an oft–used feature, you’ll injure your users.&quot; Right. And? What if the legacy software lacks features?
The decision to invest in risky, buggy legacy code vs. a rewrite is nothing more than accepting high levels of risk.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">&quot;Ensuring you have duplicated all the features...&quot; was never a goal.  Some legacy features are trash.
One of the reasons for a rewrite is to purge obsolete junk code.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">&quot;No matter how difficult refactoring may appear, rewriting will be worse.&quot; False. They're the same thing.
A rewrite <strong>is</strong> refactoring. It's refactoring with fewer constraints. It's still bound by the lessons learned
creating the original software.  Remember. The <strong>knowledge</strong> gained means a rewrite has a solid footing for designing software.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">&quot;I’ve seen over and over again, ..., developers copying and pasting code from the existing system...&quot;
That's some poor management. What was the incentive that made this appealing to the developers?
Later, talking about a C++ to Java conversion, the author suggests the &quot;code complete&quot; was somehow a goal.
If so, that's bad management.</p>
<p>Also. Most rewrites are not between two languages as similar as C++ and Java.
Rewriting COBOL to Python can't invoplve copy-and-paste.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">&quot;It is safest to estimate that the rewrite will take similar effort as the original.&quot;
This doesn't make too much sense.
First, the original cost is both some original project <strong>plus</strong> years and years of maintenance.
Further, the original project often had quite a bit of preliminary analytical work to refine the scope to something
that could be budgeted. This labor is almost <strong>never</strong> accounted for.
The time users spent helping to understand user stories? Was that part of the development budget also?
The rewrite will be less than the total of development + maintenance.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">&quot;Any time saved during development will likely be lost to making sure the new system is feature complete.&quot;
This doesn't make any sense at all. Development is development. It's all development until things are feature complete.
There's no &quot;time saved&quot; if it's not feature complete.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">&quot;The usual strategy is a big bang replacement...&quot; Okay. So that's a bad idea.
The <strong>Safeguards for Rewrites</strong> clearly serves to refute this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This &quot;Hazards&quot; section is infuriating because the tone is opaque.</p>
<p>Let's assume these are all bad arguments against a rewrite.
Let's call them &quot;Farcical Non-Hazards&quot; or &quot;Things commonly cited as hazards&quot; or something that clarifies
the tone.</p>
<p>The next section is a <strong>much</strong> more useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="safeguards-for-rewrites">
<h2>Safeguards for Rewrites</h2>
<p>Instrumentation and collect usage statistics.</p>
<p>A CI/CD pipeline to allow incremental delivery.</p>
<p>Incremental conversion working down from the highest priority until the users stop demanding legacy features.</p>
<p>This is good stuff.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Two of the three points in the summary are excellent.</p>
<p>The first bugs me.</p>
<p>&quot;A complete rewrite of an existing application or system should be your last choice&quot; is hardly worth repeating.
It's a simple cost-risk decision, and it's <strong>always</strong> on the table.</p>
<p>With extremely rich open-source ecosystems around languages like Python, the cost to rewrite
can be surprisingly low.</p>
<p>A super-fancy &quot;analytical app&quot; in an old Visual Basic program may have been reduced to a tidy
Java Spring Boot application that did some flexible analytical computations.
This may reduce, yet again, to an extract and a Jupyter Notebook handed over to skilled users.
The volume of code went from thousands of lines of VB to hundreds of lines of Java to a data dictionary
and a training class.</p>
