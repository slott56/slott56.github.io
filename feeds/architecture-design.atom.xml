&lt;p&gt;I've reached the point where progress is clearly impossible.
A bad decision a few weeks ago has reached it's inevitable conclusion.
I've made a terrible mistake.
About 1,000 lines of code -- and tons of time debugging -- are all wasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, were they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bluf-tl-dr"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BLUF (TL;DR)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, &amp;quot;mistake&amp;quot; is a synonym for &amp;quot;learning&amp;quot;.
A mistake is a lesson in what not to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't avoid mistakes.
Instead, we have to learn as much as possible from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(What about people who &amp;quot;don't learn from their mistakes&amp;quot;?
They really &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; learn.
They also refuse to change their behavior in a way that avoids making substantially similar mistakes again.
They often modify their behavior to avoid a few unpleasant aspects of a recent mistake while continuing to make related mistakes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistakes don't have a cost.
They are an investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="context"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part of Cloud Custodian (C7N), to permit writing simpler logical expressions in more conventional notation.
See &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/filters.html"&gt;https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/filters.html&lt;/a&gt; for information on the YAML-based filter notation.
It's &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; sophisticated. But, sometimes hard to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="container"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Container&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This runs in the lambda or other server context as part of Custodian.
It's not a separate process in a separate container.
It's an importable package that extends C7N's filter to include additional syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="component"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Component&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cloud-custodian/cel-python"&gt;https://github.com/cloud-custodian/cel-python&lt;/a&gt; for the code base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;were&lt;/strong&gt; looking at implementing the following conceptual model.
Until we found the counter-example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="CEL evaluation model" src="https://slott56.github.io/media/cel_notional.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;A notional design overview of some of the classes for CEL Python.
This has problems, it turns out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application will create an &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Environment&lt;/tt&gt;.
It uses this to compile a CEL expression, and then create a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Runner&lt;/tt&gt; to evaluate the expression.
(This lets you cache the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Runner&lt;/tt&gt; to reuse it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Runner&lt;/tt&gt; evaluates the expression in a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Context&lt;/tt&gt; where variables, functions, and type definitions are found.
While the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Context&lt;/tt&gt; type is shown as a name for a Python &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;dict[str, Value]&lt;/tt&gt;, it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be a protobuf message with all the stuff in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're adding the new subclasses of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Runner&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;InterpretedRunner&lt;/tt&gt; uses a subclass of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;lark.Interpreter&lt;/tt&gt; to interpret the AST and compute a final value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;CompiledRunner&lt;/tt&gt; uses a subclass of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;lark.Visitor&lt;/tt&gt; to transpile the AST into Python.
The Pythonic transpilation output is compiled, and the built-in &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;exec()&lt;/tt&gt; function computes a final value from this.
This runs at native Python speeds, and avoids the overhead of visiting AST nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="code"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's not go there.
This is about design decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-wrong"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Wrong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, it's clear -- perfectly and abundantly clear -- that the presence of CEL macros is a non-trivial feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEL has &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;some_object.map(x, some_expression_with_x)&lt;/tt&gt; as a construct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syntactically, it looks like a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.map()&lt;/tt&gt; method of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;some_object&lt;/tt&gt;.
The presence of a bind variable, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt;, and an expression where &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; is a free variable suggests this is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; simply a method.
This is nothing like the expression &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;some_string.startsWith('hello')&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;: a method with an argument value that can be immediately evaluated and produce a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEL calls it a &amp;quot;macro&amp;quot; because it's really a higher-level construct.
It's visually indistinguishable from a function, but it's semantically unrelated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python, the syntax for this is &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;(some_expression_with_x for x in some_object)&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;map(lambda x: some_expressions_with_x, some_object)&lt;/tt&gt;.
The bind variable and expression have a distinctive syntax that makes them easy to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEL lacks a distinctive syntax. Sigh.
For me, the function-like syntax was an attractive nuisance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="okay-there-are-macros"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Okay, There are Macros&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lark &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Visitor&lt;/tt&gt; is &amp;quot;bottom-up&amp;quot;.
It visits leaf nodes and then higher and higher level nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;6 * 7&lt;/tt&gt; will visit the following nodes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leaf node with literal &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;6&lt;/tt&gt;.  Nothing much to transpiling this into Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leaf node with literal &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;7&lt;/tt&gt;.  Also, really easy to transpile into Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiplication node with two leaf nodes and an operator, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt;.  Also.  Easy to transpile.
A template of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;quot;{left} * {right}&amp;quot;&lt;/tt&gt; works nicely.
Or, maybe &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;&amp;quot;operator.mul({left},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;{right})&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple design is inadequate for macro processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this: &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;['foal', 'foo', &lt;span class="pre"&gt;'four'].exists_one(n,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;n.startsWith('fo'))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this visited?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;The left-hand side:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leaf node with literal &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;'foal'&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leaf node with literal &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;'foo'&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leaf node with literal &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;'four'&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An &amp;quot;expression list&amp;quot; node to assemble the three literals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &amp;quot;list literal&amp;quot; node built from the expression list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;The right-hand side:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; variable.
&lt;span class="text-warning font-weight-bold"&gt;Warning: This is not a sub-expression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;'fo'&lt;/tt&gt; literal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An &amp;quot;expression list&amp;quot; node to build the one literal as a single-element list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;quot;dot ident arg&amp;quot; node with &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;startsWith&lt;/tt&gt; as the identifier, and the expression list node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; variable.  Again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A complete &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;n.startsWith('fo')&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; primary expression.
At this point, it's not clear that &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; is a bind variable that doesn't have a value in the default activation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An &amp;quot;expression list&amp;quot; node to build &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt;, and the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;n.startsWith('fo')&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; expression as a list.
&lt;span class="text-danger font-weight-bold"&gt;RED ALERT: This is not a list of expressions&lt;/span&gt;.
This a bind variable name and an expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;The final expression as a whole:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;A &amp;quot;dot ident arg&amp;quot; node with &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;exists_one&lt;/tt&gt; as the identifier, and the expression list node.
This can't work because the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;exists_one&lt;/tt&gt; is a macro that needs a bind variable and sub-expression.
It needs to bind multiple values to the bind variable and evaluate the sub-expression for each value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that an expression &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; (See &lt;span class="text-warning font-weight-bold"&gt;Warning&lt;/span&gt;, above) and an expression list &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;n, &lt;span class="pre"&gt;n.startsWith('fo')&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (see &lt;span class="text-danger font-weight-bold"&gt;RED ALERT&lt;/span&gt;, above) are not really part of this, but, well, they were visited and generated transpiled code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wind up with some extra, irrelevant, transpiled code floating around in our internal data structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom up is inappropriate when handling macros. The subsidiary parts -- the bind variable and the sub-expression -- need special handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lark &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Visitor&lt;/tt&gt; is doesn't fit perfectly with the approach required for Transpiling.
Stuff is visited that appears to be a useful sub-expression.
But.
It's not simply a sub-expression that can be evaluated and passed up the parse tree to compute a final answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; sub-expression only makes sense in the context of a macro binding a value to it. It's not an expression at all. It's an identifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the sub-expression with the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; variable buried in it can't be evaluated outside the macro context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every other expression can be trivially evaluated and the result passed up the parse tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-duh-factor"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Duh Factor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;InterpretedRunner&lt;/tt&gt; extended the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;lark.Interpreter&lt;/tt&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, it seemed like transpiling might be different.
We might be able to --- trivially --- rewrite the code from CEL to Python using the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;lark.Visitor&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting to a regression test failure, it is clear that we cannot &lt;strong&gt;trivially&lt;/strong&gt; transpile a macro into Python.
The simplistic &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;lark.Visitor&lt;/tt&gt; design doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="but-wait"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But Wait...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nuance here is that the transpiled pieces and parts -- in isolation -- actually &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; useful.
We need to to avoid &lt;strong&gt;trivially&lt;/strong&gt; conflating &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;object.method(arg)&lt;/tt&gt;, which has a simple value, with &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;object.macro(variable, expression)&lt;/tt&gt;, generates more complicated code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to be a two-pass operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase I&lt;/strong&gt;. A &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Visitor&lt;/tt&gt; walks the parse tree and decorates AST nodes with a Python string transpilation of the node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Literals get the Pythonic version of the CEL literal as a string.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifiers become an &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;&amp;quot;activation.{name}:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; string.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operators, functions, and methods all get normalized to a template that pulls in the children strings to create a complete Python expression string.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If all the children are strings, then the template can be transformed into a string and treated as if it were a simple literal.  For example, the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;quot;{left} * {right}&amp;quot;&lt;/tt&gt; template can be filled in right away with two literals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If any of the children are templates, short-circuits, or macros, the final creation of code has to wait for Phase II.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The short-circuit logic operators, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;_&amp;amp;&amp;amp;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;_||_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;_?_:_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; at this level are complicated templates.
It's slightly easier to defer filling them until Phase II because they build multiple lines of code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The macros (distinct from methods) require Phase II processing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase II&lt;/strong&gt;. A second &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Visitor&lt;/tt&gt; walks the parse tree, looking for the already completed decorations on AST nodes, and the templates to be completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Any unfilled templates require visiting the children, substituting them into the template, and updating the decoration from template to string.
These become simple lambdas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;expr_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;activation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;operator_template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each child will be a single blob of text, built up from numerous children involving ordinary literals and operators.
The resulting expression string used to decorate the parse tree is &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;quot;expr_{n}&amp;quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, where &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; is some unique number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Short-circuit operators are expanded into lambdas that may or may not raise exceptions that may or may not be ignored.
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;true || 42 / 0&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt;. No exception is raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ex_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_left&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;activation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;ex_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_right&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;activation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;expr_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;activation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;logical_or_function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;activation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ex_left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ex_right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;logical_or_function&lt;/tt&gt; will evaluate sub-expressions and silence exceptions as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, everything is a lambda, even the literals. It makes life simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting expression string used to decorate the parse tree is &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;quot;expr_{n}&amp;quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, where &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; is some unique number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Which brings us to macros. Example: &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;['foal', 'foo', &lt;span class="pre"&gt;'four'].exists_one(n,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;n.startsWith('fo'))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.
The left-hand side is an ordinary sub-expression. For Python's purposes, this object will be used by a generator expression to create sub-activations with the bind variable set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ex_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_left&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;activation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;foal&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;four&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;activation_gen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;activation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nested_activation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;vars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;variable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ex_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, we could use &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;map(lambda a: &lt;span class="pre"&gt;a.nested_activation(vars=dict({bind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;variable}=_value)),&lt;/span&gt; ex_{n}_left)&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we can evaluate the macro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ex_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_right&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sub_activation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;startsWith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sub_activation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;fo&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;expr_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;activation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_is_true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ex_right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;activation_gen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;activation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_is_true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This resulting block of code, while bulky, captures the macro processing.
Each of the macros has a unique expression structure, but they're all based on the built-in &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;map()&lt;/tt&gt;.
In this case, CEL &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;exists_one(...)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is an assertion that there was one result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, like everything else, the resulting expression string used to decorate the parse tree is &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;quot;expr_{n}&amp;quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, where &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; is some unique number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's important here is that we use a lark &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Visitor&lt;/tt&gt; for this, not an &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Interpreter&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-the-distinction"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's The Distinction?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lark &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Visitor&lt;/tt&gt; always visits the children first.
The results of the child visit are then available for the parent to use.
The generic &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;lark.Visitor&lt;/tt&gt; class can be decorated with types for parameters and results to clarify how the evaluation works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach is good for everything but macros.
The literal nodes roll up into the primary nodes that roll up into various priorities of expression nodes.
The final, top-most &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;expr&lt;/tt&gt; node can be an amalgamation of all the visited children.
Operations are properly nested by the AST definitions of relation, addition, and multiplication grammar productions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lark &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Interpreter&lt;/tt&gt; doesn't visit the children automatically.
The application methods must explicitly call &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;visit()&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;visit_children()&lt;/tt&gt; as needed.
When interpreting the AST to evaluate it, this is an annoying detail until we get to macros.
For macros, it's imperative to not trivially visit the children. See the &lt;span class="text-warning font-weight-bold"&gt;Warning&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="text-danger font-weight-bold"&gt;RED ALERT&lt;/span&gt;, above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For evaluation, processing must work like this.
First, evaluate the left-hand side to get an object.
The first child of the macro node has the bind variable.
For each value in the object, create a sub-activation with the bind variable;
then, visit only the second child of the macro node to get a value.
This limited use of visiting children makes it easy to implement interpretation of a macro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same kind of processing can apply to transpiling a macro into Python.
Or.
As shown above, we can do two passes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the easy non-macro transpilation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;macro transpilation, which doesn't &lt;strong&gt;trivially&lt;/strong&gt; roll the children up into the parent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-cost-of-the-mistake"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Cost of the Mistake&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistakes don't have a cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fallacy. A big one. One that cripples technical management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistakes are an investment in learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, it's about 1,000 lines of code that will be reworked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took hours to create and debug the code I'm about to delete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will take hours to replace them with something that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="upperalpha simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Has a simple example that absolutely requires the more sophisticated design.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;(Note that I didn't have this until a specific regression test failed.)&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benefits from the the incorrect version, and working examples of the various kinds of lambda templates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final point is really important and under-valued:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Refactoring is Easier than Initial Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks have an unwarranted fear of refactoring and the &amp;quot;cost&amp;quot; of rework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="could-i-have-prevented-this"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Could I Have Prevented This?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dream of methodology designers everywhere is to placate managers with an approach this will avoid this investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dream is to be able to make this claim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;Follow my method and you won't waste time digging in some rat-hole right up to a dead end.&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's nonsensical about this is that there needs to be some level of actual &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's nonsense because someone has to deeply understand this problem, and leverage that understanding to avoid writing bad code.
Someone has to put in hours understanding the problem to avoid the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What form does this detailed &amp;quot;understanding&amp;quot; take?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the waterfall dream claim was a &amp;quot;detailed design document.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this document was based on what, exactly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staring at a whiteboard?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expensive multi-person meetings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long, expensive, pointless conversations with an hallucinating AI tool.
(Watch &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; for more on hallucination-prone AI tools.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, is the detailed design document based on draft code that demonstrates a problem?
The design-level draft is used to create a design document.
Which is then used to create final code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the olden days this was considered a non-starter.
Code was expensive.
Those days are past.
Draft code is part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Current me needs to go outside and do something that doesn't involve software or complexity.
Sadly, current me is trying to make one small change and it feels like the software has  passed out of the realm of manageable complexity into that space of unknowable chaos.
Considering the heliopause, I feel like there's a simpli-pause out there, and I'm drifting past it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bluf-tl-dr"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BLUF (TL;DR)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no big, simple lesson up front.
Except, maybe this: &amp;quot;Simplicity requires hard work.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe quote Pascal's apology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have made this longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think complexity stems from failure to budget enough time to find the useful patterns and simplify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What concrete steps can we take to simplify? Read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="context"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cloud-custodian/cel-python"&gt;https://github.com/cloud-custodian/cel-python&lt;/a&gt; for the code base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the following conceptual model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="CEL evaluation model" src="https://slott56.github.io/media/cel_old.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;An overview of some of the classes. There's more. Too much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application will create an &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Environment&lt;/tt&gt;.
It uses this to compile a CEL expression, and then create a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Runner&lt;/tt&gt; to evaluate the expression.
(This lets you cache the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Runner&lt;/tt&gt; to reuse it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Runner&lt;/tt&gt; evaluates the expression in a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Context&lt;/tt&gt; where variables, functions, and type definitions are found.
While the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Context&lt;/tt&gt; type is shown as a name for a Python &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;dict[str, Value]&lt;/tt&gt;, it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be a protobuf message with all the stuff in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the runner uses a subclass of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;lark.Interpreter&lt;/tt&gt; to interpret the AST.
This involves a fair amount of navigating through the AST structure.
This isn't too much overhead, but it can be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to explore some ways to reduce the overheads.
Two seem clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk the syntax tree, appending operations to a sequence of function evaluations.
To evaluate the expression, execute the sequence of operations.
This is tidy, and not fraught with too much complexity until we get to conditional and iterative processing.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conditional processing&lt;/strong&gt; comes from the short-circuiting &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;_&amp;amp;&amp;amp;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;_||_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;_?_:_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; operators. (The CEL folks like to write their operators with &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;_&lt;/tt&gt; to show where operands go.) These involves skipping over the parts that don't need to be evaluated.
Sadly, the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;_&amp;amp;&amp;amp;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;_||_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; are commutative, so &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;true || 42 / 0&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;42 / 0 || true&lt;/tt&gt; are both &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt;.  Use of a monad can make this tolerably simple. But that's not how it was implemented.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iterative processing&lt;/strong&gt; comes from &amp;quot;macro&amp;quot; evaluation.
CEL expresses this with higher-order functions (map, filter, exists, etc.) that are applied to a sub-expression, and an object, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;[1, 2, &lt;span class="pre"&gt;3].map(x,&lt;/span&gt; 3*x+1)&lt;/tt&gt; sort of thing.
This is similar to Python's &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;map(lambda x: 3*x+1, [1, 2, 3])&lt;/tt&gt;.
The concept behind the CEL specification calling this a &amp;quot;macro&amp;quot;, is that the sequence of operations involved in the iteration can be viewed as a single &amp;quot;macro&amp;quot; operation in the overall sequence. A &amp;quot;sub-interpreter&amp;quot; can handle the macro operation, returning a result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transpile the syntax tree into Python.
Use the built-in &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;compile()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;exec()&lt;/tt&gt; functions to evaluate the expression.
The transpile-and-compile creates byte code.
This will be rather fast.
And we can leverage projects like &lt;strong&gt;cython&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cython.org"&gt;https://cython.org&lt;/a&gt;) if we want even more speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to proceed, of course, we need some benchmarking data to show where the performance penalties might be hiding.
The profiling data suggests transpiling doesn't hold much promise.
But.
It's also a logical feature to consider.
In principle, the desgin permitted adding a compiled runner.
In principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="container-component-code"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Container, Component, Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case it's helpful, CEL isn't a stand-alone application.
It's an expression language that can be embedded anywhere you need expressions.
A CEL-enabled version of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;bash&lt;/tt&gt;, for example, would be far more expressive than the  version that has &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;(( ))&lt;/tt&gt; expressions and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;[ ]&lt;/tt&gt; expressions using different sub-languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pure-Python implementation does have a CLI and can replace &lt;strong&gt;jq&lt;/strong&gt;, but that's above and beyond the core language specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code-wise, it depends on the &lt;strong&gt;Lark parser&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&lt;/a&gt;)  for the parser and abstract syntax tree definition.
We add a package of CEL types to provide Go-like semantics instead of Python semantics.
(This means offering &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;int32&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;int64&lt;/tt&gt;, for example.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="so-what"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, what?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good question. What's the complexity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, only need a subclass of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Runner&lt;/tt&gt; that transpiles instead of interprets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How hard can that be? Really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to side-bar into the root-causes of complexity.
You might want to skip down to &lt;a class="reference internal" href="#fine-it-was-complicated-what-did-i-do"&gt;Fine. It Was Complicated. What Did I Do?&lt;/a&gt;.
This is how I took a step back from the complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you care, here's the complexity. In detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="brain-breaking"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Brain-Breaking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What broke my brain was the subtle differences between the binding of identifier to a type and (optionally) an object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;When interpreting the syntax tree, the binding must be discovered when interpreting the value of an identifier.
Clearly, this starts with looking it up in the collection of variables, add-on functions, add-on types,
built-in functions, and built-in types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any given name can have two definitions: a type annotation and an optional value.
In principle, the value needs an associated type.
Pragmatically -- in Python -- a Python type is already bound to the value, and we don't &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; care very much about this detail.
In other implementations (e.g. Go) the value is a bunch of bytes, and without the type information, nothing can happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;When transpiling. Ah.
This is interesting because the transpilation doesn't care about variable values.
Where evaluation of the transpiled (and compiled) code does care about variable values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When building Python from the CEL expression, we need to resolve type names and function names to an implementation class or function.
The class and function &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; exist at transpile time so we can translate a CEL &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;uint32&lt;/tt&gt; into the Python &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;celtypes.Uint32Type&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When executing the compiled code, we still need a context, but this only needs the variable value bindings.
The other names have already been resolved into local Python class and function references.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so good, right? What's brain-breaking about this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complexity was deeply buried in implementation details of the interpreter.
Specifically, it maintained a pointless and unhelpful distinction between types, functions, and variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Types are a simple namespace.
The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;celpy&lt;/tt&gt; module, for example, defines all the CEL-visible types. New types can be added, leading to a union of type names.
Ideally, these have a precedence, so new types can replace the built-in types.
But. It's all very simple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functions are a mapping from name to implementation.
The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;celpy&lt;/tt&gt; module provides the built-in mapping from non-Pythonic names like &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;&amp;quot;_&amp;amp;&amp;amp;_&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;logical_and()&lt;/tt&gt; function.
You're not supposed to override these names, but, it's a simple dictionary, so you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variables are a pair of mappings: name to type, and (optionally) name to value.
It's sensible to provide a type annotation for a variable that never gets a value.
For example, in this expression,
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;choice == &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; ? a / 42 : b / 42&lt;/tt&gt;, there must be a value for &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt;.
Whether or not a value is provided for &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;b&lt;/tt&gt;, however, depends on the value provided for &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, the three varieties of identifiers are all the same.
This simple uniformity was &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; part of the original implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-bad-path-followed-badly"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Bad Path Followed Badly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type-function-variable distinction was a bad idea, followed through to it's logical confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation had two collections (not three!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type names and variable names.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Function names.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three collections would have made more sense, but, there are slightly different use cases.
These only became clear when transpiling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Function name resolution happened at &amp;quot;compile&amp;quot; time.
Even when doing interpreted evaluation of the parse tree, these names were evaluated on a distinct logic path from type names and variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type and variable name resolution only happened at evaluation time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want some extra complexity? When a type name is used like a function name in CEL.
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;uint32(42)&lt;/tt&gt; is valid code.
When interpreting, it required looking up the name &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;quot;uint32&amp;quot;&lt;/tt&gt; in both the function and the type mappings.
It wasn't too awkwardly complicated, but it was yet another complication buried in the interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fine-it-was-complicated-what-did-i-do"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fine. It Was Complicated. What Did I Do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the diagram up above?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by trying to draw pictures to capture the essence of the design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, I drew some UML class diagrams to capture the legacy design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, I draw some UML class diagrams to capture the new design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempting to capture the class models made it clear how complicated the picture where.
To cope with the complicated diagrams, I started writing an explanation for my future self to understand them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Complexity is hard to explain, and that makes it bad.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition note"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not fire up some AI-based sparking autocomplete tool to &amp;quot;summarize&amp;quot; this for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;I didn't want summary-like slop that included my software component names filling in placeholders in the text.
I wanted to actually understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I started jotting down notes to describe the pictures, I began to see the essential truth here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If it's hard to explain, that reveals a problem: rewrite it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could barely capture notes on how complicated it was.
Here's what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Instead of describing it, my brain kept trying to rewrite it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've come to realize this feeling is profound, and helpful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When a rewrite seems to be less work than creating an explanation, do the rewrite.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="enterprise-management"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Enterprise Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a for-profit enterprise software development environment, there's pressure to call something &amp;quot;done&amp;quot; when it isn't really done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complexity is tolerated. Simplicity is sacrificed when it seems to be expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In actuality, complexity is technical debt, and the liability's drag on the enterprise accumulates quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm aware that a lot of managers are forced to say things like &amp;quot;But in the real world, we have to stop gold-plating and simply call it done.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is nonsense, but it's also very hard to counter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice for coping with pushy managers?
Try asking them to draw the picture.
Wait patiently, then you can add some missing details.
It's important not to simply add overwhelming piles details, but add selected details to expose a bad complexity.
This may lead them to them telling you to make it simpler so it fits their concepts.
When they tell you to fix the thing you want to fix, that's the ideal outcome; be sure to sulk anyway so they feel like they told you to do something you didn't want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="better-design"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Better Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, it became clear that an identifier is a mapping from &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;str&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;tuple[type, Any] | tuple[type]&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;A type name like &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;quot;Whatever&amp;quot;&lt;/tt&gt; maps to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;(celpy.TypeType, celpy.WhateverType)&lt;/tt&gt;.
There's a type and a value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;A function name like &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;size&lt;/tt&gt; maps to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;(celpy.CELFunction, size_function)&lt;/tt&gt;.
And, yes, a more detailed signature &lt;strong&gt;could&lt;/strong&gt; be part of this, but -- for Python -- it doesn't really matter if it has 0, 1, 2, or 3 parameters.
Any problem surfaces (later) as a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;TypeError&lt;/tt&gt; when trying to evaluate a function with improper arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could leverage the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Callable&lt;/tt&gt; generic. &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;(celpy.CELFunction[[Any,&lt;/span&gt; Any], celpy.BoolType], lambda x, y: x == y)&lt;/tt&gt;, could be the definition for &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;&amp;quot;_==_&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.
It doesn't add too much complexity, but, we'll generally ignore it, because it doesn't create much value to do this extra work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;A variable has a type annotation (expected at compile time) supplemented by a value (required at evaluation time.)
Initially a variable is a singleton tuple with a type, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;(celpy.Int32Type,)&lt;/tt&gt;.
For evaluation, the context will replace this with a two-tuple that contains the actual value, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;(celpy.Int32Type, celpy.Int32Type(42))&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's important is that -- in Python -- the type information isn't &lt;strong&gt;required&lt;/strong&gt; at compile time.
Since other CEL implementations need it, it's expected, and we can raise exceptions when it's not available, even though we don't use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifier name resolution can be simplified: a name needs to map to a tuple.
The first element is always present, and is the type.
The second element may be missing; when present, this is the value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard part is replacing the previous complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

What's essential is this little complication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.charlottecountyfl.gov/departments/public-works/maintenance-operations/south-gulf-cove-boat-lock.stml"&gt;South Gulf Cove Boat Lock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lock keeps saltwater from Charlotte Harbor out of the canal system
in South Gulf Cove.
The creek beyond the lock is subject to silting.
We'd like to be &lt;strong&gt;sure&lt;/strong&gt; we don't run aground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="filter-rules"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Filter Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two critical criteria for passing through the lock:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High tide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the afternoon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lock and the associated creeks and canals tend to silt
up over time. Water moves slowly through the water system.
High tide helps get us over the sandbars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a bit over a three-hour trip from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.safecoveinc.com"&gt;Safe Cove Boat Storage and Marina&lt;/a&gt;
to the lock.
If we start at 06:00, we're not getting out before 10:00.
And.
Who wants to get up at 05:00 to prep for departure at first light?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Okay. I've done that. See &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://itmaybeahack.com/TeamRedCruising2/Schooner_Creek__Not_our_best_idea.html"&gt;Schooner Creek — Not our best idea&lt;/a&gt;.
It's not ideal, but we can make it work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we know when high tide is? NOAA provides that information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="raw-data"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Raw Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tides have a well-understood model.
This is a triumph of big-data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It leads to files like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatideannual.html?id=8725769"&gt;https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatideannual.html?id=8725769&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. That's a right mess of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a big multi-line header.
It's followed by columns of details.
The details have slightly irregular tab characters, making parsing annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load it into Numbers and fool with it more-or-less manually looking the afternoon high-tides we can make use of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load it into a Jupyter Lab Notebook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a one-time thing, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, we're going to redo this little computation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I hear you. Once a year isn't very often.
The principle is this: the manual steps are hard to record
and reproduce.
It's much, much more reliable to build a notebook for
repeatable results.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll repeat that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Build a Notebook For Repeatable Results.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the essential features of that notebook.
It's a three-step process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll begin at the beginning: acquiring the raw data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="step-1-acquire"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1. Acquire&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. The data was already downloaded. Done. Check.
We need to extract a meaningful structure from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, strip that god-awful header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
def header(source: TextIO) -&amp;gt; dict[str, str]:
    content = {}
    for row in source:
        if (clean := row.rstrip()) == '':
            break
        label, _, value = clean.partition(&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;)
        content[label] = value
    return content
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function extracts the header lines
to make a little dictionary with the metadata.
The value of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;metadata['StationName']&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is particularly
useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This changes the state of the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;source&lt;/tt&gt; object.
It advances it to the first line after the header.
This line has the column titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For some, this state change is a kind of functional programming no-no.
A proper functional approach might involve defining some kind
of monad that can be used to represent the file split,
preserving the order.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The column titles are in wrong positions with regard
to the data. This offset makes them essentially useless except
as a visual cue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what we observe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
tide_csv[0:2]

[['Date ', '', 'Day', 'Time', '', 'Pred(Ft)', 'Pred(cm)', 'High/Low'],
 ['2023/01/01', 'Sun', '06:35 AM', '-0.13', '', '-4', '', '', 'L']]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the first pass at a kind of named-tuple or dataclass
to structure the source text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

&amp;#64;dataclass
class Tide:
    date: str
    day: str
    time: str
    pred_ft: str
    pred_cm: str
    high_low: str

    &amp;#64;classmethod
    def from_csvrow(cls, row):
        return cls(
            date=row[0],
            day=row[1],
            time=row[2],
            pred_ft=row[3],
            pred_cm=row[5],
            high_low=row[8]
        )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a fan of including builders within the class
definition. With a tiny prevarication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;from_csvrow()&lt;/tt&gt; function is dependent
on something &lt;strong&gt;outside&lt;/strong&gt; this class.
Therefore we can argue this breaks the &lt;strong&gt;SOLID&lt;/strong&gt; design
principles -- this class has than one reason to change:
an internal representation change and an external parsing change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The Open-Closed principle still applies. Subclasses have have different parsers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are multiple sources, or the source is some hack
built as a temporary stop-gap as part of Enterprise software development,]
then separate parsers are helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Enterprise in-house programmers are sometimes told to build junk.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is from a government agency. Change will arise at a stately pace.
Including a parser/builder method in the class is fair because I &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; expect to see this source format change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="step-2-clean-and-transform"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2. Clean and Transform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's only a little bit of this data we need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The predicted height in feet &amp;quot;Pred(Ft)&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The timestamp built from &amp;quot;Date&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The High/Low flag telling us the tide's state. We like to make trick transits &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; high-tide so the rising tide can help float us free of trouble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day, for example, is redundant and computed from the date.
The predicted height in cm is a multiplication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have two general approaches for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For complex, fluid situations with multiple sources and formats, it helps to separate clean data from raw data. This means creating a secondary class, built from the raw (&amp;quot;all strings&amp;quot;) source class. This class can have a more useful structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For this kind of stable data, we can enrich the dataclass with &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;init=False&lt;/tt&gt; fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from enum import Enum
import datetime

class HighLow(str, Enum):
    High = &amp;quot;H&amp;quot;
    Low = &amp;quot;L&amp;quot;

&amp;#64;dataclass
class Tide:
    date: str
    day: str
    time: str
    pred_ft: str
    pred_cm: str
    high_low: str
    timestamp: datetime.datetime = field(init=False)
    height: float = field(init=False)
    state: HighLow = field(init=False)

    &amp;#64;classmethod
    def from_csvrow(cls, row):
        return cls(
            date=row[0],
            day=row[1],
            time=row[2],
            pred_ft=row[3],
            pred_cm=row[5],
            high_low=row[8]
        )

    def __post_init__(self):
        date = datetime.datetime.strptime(self.date, '%Y/%m/%d').date()
        time = datetime.datetime.strptime(self.time, '%I:%M %p').time()
        self.timestamp = datetime.datetime.combine(date, time)
        self.height = float(self.pred_ft)
        self.state = HighLow(self.high_low)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;field(init=False)&lt;/tt&gt; attributes are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; provided from the source.
These are derived.
The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;__post_init__()&lt;/tt&gt; method computes the useful derived values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These values can also be &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;#64;property&lt;/tt&gt; methods.
Indeed, they started out as properties.
There are only about 1200 rows of data, so the performance advantage of one-time computation is miniscule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For completeness, here's the overall parser for this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
def tides(source_csv):
    for line in source_csv:
        if len(line) != 9:
            continue
        yield Tide.from_csvrow(line)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the list of CSV rows (or a generator for the CSV rows)
this will iterate over the rows, building &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Tide&lt;/tt&gt; instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="step-3-when-do-we-go"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3. When Do We Go?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we can start analysis.
The fundamental question is this &amp;quot;When to we leave?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is &amp;quot;When the lock is passable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
def passable(t):
    return all([
        t.state == HighLow.High,     # High tide
        11 &amp;lt;= t.timestamp.hour &amp;lt; 18  # Late morning and afternoon
    ])
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to to know the high-tide time so we can back off three hours.
We need to arrive at the lock in daylight, and we don't want to get up at 05:00 (pre-dawn).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final cell in this notebook?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
for t in tides(tide_csv):
    if passable(t) and t.timestamp.month in {3, 4, 5}:
        print(f&amp;quot;{t.timestamp} {t.height:6.2f} {t.state.name}&amp;quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tells us what we need to know about making the lock
in daylight with a good probability of enough water out in the harbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still have to fix Hurricane Ian damage.
We're not 100% the engine will start.
The solar panels are a wreck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't know where we might go.
A lot the South Florida Gulf Coast is still a right-awful mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe all we'll be able to do is
drop the anchor at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://activecaptain.garmin.com/en-US/pois/46419"&gt;Punta Gorda&lt;/a&gt; for a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-s-o-l-i-d-programming-principles/welcome"&gt;LinkedIn Learning
course&lt;/a&gt;
covers these in (what I think is) a more useful order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interface Segregation&lt;/strong&gt;. I think this is the place to start: make
your interfaces as small as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liskov Substitution&lt;/strong&gt;. Where necessary, leverage inheritance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open/Closed&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a good quality check to be sure you've
followed the first two principles well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dependency Injection&lt;/strong&gt;. This is often about test design and future
expansion. In Python, where everything really happens at run time, we
often fail to parameterize a type properly. We often figure that out
a test time, and need to revisit the Open/Closed principle to get
things right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Responsibility&lt;/strong&gt; is more of a summary of the previous
principles than a distinct, new principle. I think it comes last and
should be treated as a collection of good ideas, not a single idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think time spent on the first three -- Interface Segregation, Liskov
Substitution, and the Open/Closed principle -- pay off tremendously. The
ILODS acronym, though, isn't as cool as SOLID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Single Responsibility&amp;quot; suffers from an ambiguous context. At one
level of abstraction, all classes have a single responsibility. As we
dive into details, we uncover multiple responsibilities. The further we
descend into implementation details the more responsibilities we
uncover. I prefer to consider this a poetic summary, not the first step
in reviewing a design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Responsibility&lt;/strong&gt; -- This is essentially a summary of the
above four principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point here is that these principles are pleasantly poetic, but there
are those edgy cases where an interface can go either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, here's an Edgy Case that can go either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're reading GPX (GPS Exchange) data.
See &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1/"&gt;https://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associated with this is what's known as the Lowrance USR file format. A
lot of devices include the same (or similar) underlying software, and
can exchange waypoint and route information in USR format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have this as part of the underlying model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The underlying &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Angle&lt;/tt&gt; as an abstraction. This has two subclasses:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latitude. An angle with &amp;quot;N&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; for its sign, conventionally
shown as a two-digit number of degrees: &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;25°42.925′N&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Longitude. An angle with &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;W&amp;quot; for its sign, conventionally
shown as a three-digit number of degrees: &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;080°13.617′W&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Point (or &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;LatLon&lt;/tt&gt;) is a two-tuple, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;tuple[Lat, Lon]&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A waypoint includes name, description, a time-of-last-update (TOLU), and
display symbol to be used. It may also include a GUID to track name
changes and assure uniqueness in spite of repeated names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. Nothing too edgy there. &amp;quot;Where's the problem?&amp;quot; you ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In GPX files, latitude and longitude are float values in degrees. You'll
see this: &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;wpt &lt;span class="pre"&gt;lon=&amp;quot;-80.22695124&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;lat=&amp;quot;25.7154147&amp;quot;&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/wpt&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do any useful computation, they need to be radians. Or a geocode that
supports proximity comparisons, like OLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And. If you work with a CSV export from a tool like
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://opencpn.org"&gt;OpenCPN&lt;/a&gt;, then you get strings. This can be any
combination of degrees and minutes or degrees, minutes, and seconds.
And, depending on the software, there may be either ° or º for the
degrees. Can't tell the apart? One is U+00B0, the DEGREE SIGN. The other
is U+00BA, the MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR. Plus, of course, everyone
uses apostrophe (') and quote (&amp;quot;) where they should have used prime (′)
and double prime (″). These are easy regular expression problems to
solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to a class like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
class Angle(float):
    &amp;#64;classmethod
    def fromdegrees(cls, deg: float, hemisphere: Optional[str] = None) -&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Angle&amp;quot;:
        ...
    &amp;#64;classmethod
    def fromstring(cls, value: str) -&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Angle&amp;quot;:
        ...
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Angle class converts numbers or strings into useful values; in
radians internally. Formatted in degrees externally.  (And yes, this
gets a warning from Python 3.9 that we can't usefully extend float like
this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is USR files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In USR files, they use millimeter mercator numbers for latitude and
longitude. These are distances from the equator or the prime meridian.
Because they're in millimeters, an integer will do nicely. A little
computation is done to extract degrees (or radians) from these values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
SEMIMINOR_B = 6_356_752.3142

lon = round(math.degrees(mm_lon / SEMIMINOR_B), 8)
lat = round(
        math.degrees(2 * math.atan(math.exp(mm_lat / SEMIMINOR_B)) - math.pi / 2), 8
    )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't too bad. But.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does this belong? Is it part of the underlying &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Angle&lt;/tt&gt; class? It
is separate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="where-does-millimeter-mercator-representation-belong"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where does Millimeter Mercator representation belong?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises a secondary question: Where does ANY representation belong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we separate the essential object (an angle in radians, a float) from
all representation questions? If so, how do we properly bind value and
representation at run time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is our app full of complex mixins to bind the float with representation
choices?  &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;class Latitude(float, DMS, MM, &lt;span class="pre"&gt;etc.):&lt;/span&gt; pass&lt;/tt&gt;. This seems
potentially annoyingly complex: we have to make sure names don't
collide, when defining all these aspects separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the representation for latitudes and longitudes *is* the
essential problem here. The math (i.e. computing the loxodromic distance
between points) is trivially separated from all of these representation
concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we buy into the centrality of representation issues, then, we're down
to the following argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolution&lt;/strong&gt;: millimeter mercator belongs in the Angle class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affirmative&lt;/strong&gt;: it's yet another representation of an angle's value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negative&lt;/strong&gt;: it's not used outside USR files and belongs in the USR file parser module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affirmative Rebuttal&lt;/strong&gt;: None of the other representations in Angle are tied specifically to a file format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negative Rebuttal&lt;/strong&gt;: Because the other formats (float, string) are
intermixed in CSV files and text displays, making them &amp;quot;widely used.&amp;quot;
While float is used consistently in GPX, this encoding is a pleasant
exception that relies on widely-used encodings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. We seem to have conflicting goals here. Some representation is a
generic thing that crosses file formats and some representation is
localized to a specific file format and not reused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SOLID design principles don't help chose between these designs.
Instead, they provide post-hoc justification for the design we chose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can exploit the SOLID principles in a variety of ways. Some Examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could claim that LatitudeMM is a subclass of Latitude with the MM
conversions mixed in. Open/Closed. Liskov Substitution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could claim that Latitude has several load/dump strategies
available, including Load from MM. Open/Closed. Dependency is
Injected at run-time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="prior-art"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prior Art&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods like &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;__str__()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;__repr__()&lt;/tt&gt; are generally considered
part of the essential class. That means the most common string
representations need to be provided. The parsing of a string, similarly,
is the constructor for  an instance of the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. Some representations are part of the class. Clearly, however, not
all representations are part of the class. Representation codecs like
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;pickle&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;struct&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ctype&lt;/tt&gt; are kept separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to make the case that there's a very, very fine line between
unique and non-unique-but-not-widely-used aspects of a class of objects.
And, in this specific case, the millimeter mercator should be kept
separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to rely on other representations like PlusCode (also called
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Location_Code"&gt;OLC&lt;/a&gt;) as yet
another obscure representation and insist these aren't essential to the
class. Indeed, I'm going to suggest that proximity-friendly geocoding is
clearly separate because it's a hack to replace complex distance
computations with substring comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

suspenders person who switched to belts, the idea of wearing both is a
little like over-engineering. In the unlikely event of catastrophic
failure of one system, your pants can still remain properly hoist.
There's a weird, but defensible reason for that. Most over-engineering
lacks a coherent reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we call them &amp;quot;Bells and Whistles.&amp;quot; The solution has both
bells and whistles for signaling. This is usually used in a
derogatory sense of useless noisemakers, there for show only. Again,
there's a really low-value and dumb, but defensible reason for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While colorful, none of this is helpful for describing
over-engineered software. Over-engineered software is often
over-engineered for incoherent and indefensible reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over-engineering generally means trying to solve a problem that no
user actually has. This leads to throwing around irrelevant features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="concrete-example"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concrete Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lived on a boat. I spent a fair amount of time fretting over
navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two big questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How far apart are two points, really.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's the real bearing from one point to another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are -- in some cases -- easy to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a printed, paper chart at the right scale, you can use
dividers to compute a distance. It's actually a very easy task.
Similarly, you can read the bearing off the chart directly. There's a
trick to comparing a course to a nearby compass rose, but it's easy
to learn and very accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we don't want to painstakingly copy our notes from a paper
chart to a spreadsheet to add them up to get total distance. And then
fold in speed to get time and fuel consumption. These summary
computations are a pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you want is to do all of this with a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plot the points using a piece of software like OpenCPN (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://opencpn.org"&gt;https://opencpn.org&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract the GPX file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compute distances, bearings, and durations to create a route.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So?&amp;quot; you ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. When I did this, I researched the math and got a grip on the
haversine formula for doing the spherical geometry computation of
distances between points on a sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not too bad. The formula are big-ish. But manageable.
See &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.edwilliams.org/avform.htm#Dist"&gt;http://www.edwilliams.org/avform.htm#Dist&lt;/a&gt; for the great circle
distance formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="formula"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = 2×arcsin&lt;span class="sqrt"&gt;&lt;span class="radical"&gt;√&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ignored"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="root"&gt;&lt;span class="bigdelimiter size3"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sin&lt;span class="fraction"&gt;&lt;span class="ignored"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="numerator"&gt;&lt;i&gt;ϕ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − &lt;i&gt;ϕ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ignored"&gt;)/(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="denominator"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ignored"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bigdelimiter size3"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + cos&lt;i&gt;ϕ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;×cos&lt;i&gt;ϕ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×&lt;span class="bigdelimiter size3"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sin&lt;span class="fraction"&gt;&lt;span class="ignored"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="numerator"&gt;&lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − &lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ignored"&gt;)/(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="denominator"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ignored"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bigdelimiter size3"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ignored"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For airplanes and powered freighters crossing oceans, this is
perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a small sailboat going from Annapolis, Maryland, to the Bahamas,
this level of complexity is craziness. While accurate, it doesn't
really solve the problem I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't actually need that much accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need this much accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="formula"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;span class="sqrt"&gt;&lt;span class="radical"&gt;√&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ignored"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="root"&gt;[&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;×(&lt;i&gt;ϕ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − &lt;i&gt;ϕ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + [&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;×cos&lt;i&gt;ϕ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;×(&lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − &lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ignored"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no more. This is the essential hypotenuse distance using an
R-factor to convert the difference between latitudes and the distance
between longitudes into pretty-close distances. For nautical miles, R
is 60×180÷π.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is simpler and it solves the problem I actually have. Up to
about 232 miles, the answer is within 1 mile of correct. The error
grows quickly. Double the distance and the error seems to jump to 8
miles. A 464 mile sailing journey (at 6 knots) takes 3 days. Wind,
weather, tides and currents will introduce more error than the
simplifying assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's important is this can be put into a spreadsheet without pain.
I don't &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; to write sophisticated Python apps to apply
haversine to sequences of way-points. I can do a simpler hypotenuse
computation on waypoints converted to radians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="is-there-a-lesson-learned"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is there a lesson learned?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's the haversine a super-general solution. It handles
great-circle routes elegantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it doesn't solve my actual problem. And that makes it
over-engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My problem is what we call rhumb-line sailing. Over short-enough
distances the world may as well be flat. Over slightly longer
distances, errors in the ship's compass and speedometer make a
hyper-accurate great circle route moot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Even with several fancy GPS-based navigation computers, a prudent
mariner has paper backups. The list of waypoints, estimated times and
directions are essential when the boat's GPS reciever fails.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't really need the sophistication (and the potential for bugs)

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a question about else: clause and the exception raised there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's impossible. In this specific case, a little algebra can provide
that it's impossible. In more complex cases, the algebra can be
challenging. In some cases, external dependencies may make the
algebra impossible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's needless in general. An &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;else:&lt;/tt&gt; would have been better than the
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;elif n &amp;gt;= m:&lt;/tt&gt;.  The problem with &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;else:&lt;/tt&gt; is that a poor design, or poor
coordination with the external dependencies, can lead to undetectable
errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at something a little more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
def ackermann(m: int, n: int) -&amp;gt; int:
    if m &amp;lt; 0 or n &amp;lt; 0:
        raise ValueError(f&amp;quot;{m} and {n} must be non-negative&amp;quot;)
    if m == 0:
        return n + 1
    elif m &amp;gt; 0 and n == 0:
        return ackermann(m - 1, 1)
    elif m &amp;gt; 0 and n &amp;gt; 0:
        return ackermann(m - 1, ackermann(m, n - 1))
    else:
        raise Exception(f&amp;quot;Design Error: {vars()}&amp;quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's somewhat less clear in this case that the else: is impossible. A
little more algebra is required to create a necessary proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core argument here is &lt;strong&gt;Edge Cases Are Inevitable&lt;/strong&gt;. While we can
try very assiduously to prevent them, they seem to be an emergent
feature of complex software. There are two arguments that seem to
indicate the inevitability of edge and corner cases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scale&lt;/strong&gt;. For simple cases, with not too many branches and not too
many variables, the algebra is manageable. As the branches and
variables grow, the analysis becomes more difficult and more subject
to error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dependencies&lt;/strong&gt;. For some cases, this kind of branching can be
refactored into a polymorphic class hierarchy, and the
decision-making superficially simplified. In other cases, there are
multiple, disjoint states and multiple conditions related to those
states, and the reasoning becomes more prone to errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The noble path is to use abstraction techniques to eliminate them.
This is aspirational in some cases. While it's always the right thing
to do, we need to check our work. And testing isn't always
sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The noble path is subject to simple errors. While we can be very,
very, very, very careful in our design, there will still be obscure
cases which are very, very, very, very, &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; subtle. We can omit
a condition from our analysis, and our unit tests, and all of our
colleagues and everyone reviewing the pull request can be equally
snowed by the complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have two choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presume we are omniscient and act accordingly: use else: clauses
as if we are incapable of error. Treat all complex if-elif chains
as if they were trivial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act more humbly and try to detect our failure to be omniscient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we acknowledge the possibility of a design error, what exception
class should we use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RuntimeError&lt;/strong&gt;. In a sense, it's an error which didn't occur
until we ran the application and some edge case cropped up.
However. The error was *always* present. It was a design error,
a failure to be truly omniscient and properly prove all of our
if-elif branches were complete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DesignError&lt;/strong&gt;. We didn't think this would happen. But it did.
And we need debugging information to see what exact confluence of
variables caused the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I submit that &lt;strong&gt;DesignError&lt;/strong&gt; be added to the pantheon of Python
exceptions. I'm wondering if I should make an attempt to write and
submit a PEP on this. Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;As I get more serious about this data science stuff, it has become
obvious that a windows machine is not the way to go. ...
Q1: What other things should I think about and consider while
shopping for a new computer?
Q2: Are there issues w/ running VmWare and Windows 7 w/in VmWare on
Ubuntu?
&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've omitted many, many words (400 or so.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are all of the functional requirements I could discern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would like to have 1 machine. I don't want a desktop and a laptop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install VmWare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Windows 7 using VmWare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; of the functional requirements. The other 400 words
involved specifications. Nothing that approaches a use case other
than singular, VMWare, and Windows under VMWare. The form factor of
laptop, which seems to go without saying, might be a user story, but
that's pushing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;a windows machine is not the way to go&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Install Windows 7&amp;quot;
indicate a fairly serious problem. It is not the way to go &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt;
it's required. Both. This is doomed to inevitable failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the way to make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="q1-what-other-things-should-i-think-about"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q1. What other things should I think about?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just about every other thing. Start with use cases and functional
requirements. Skip over specifications. (In general, never start with
specifications because that's where you end: a list of useless
numbers that don't bracket what you actually want to do.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use Cases Matter. Specifications Don't Matter.
Write down all the Mbs and Tbs you want. Without a use case, they're
irrelevant noisy details. Throw the numbers away until you have a
list of verbs. Things you will DO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so few actual functional requirements, almost &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; computer
(possibly including a Raspberry Pi 3) would pass the suite of
acceptance test cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✅ One Machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✅ VMWare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✅ Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lot more back-and-forth, I discerned one (or maybe two)
additional functional requirement(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://leoeditor.com/"&gt;leo&lt;/a&gt; w/ java to gen html.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know what &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://leoeditor.com/"&gt;Leo&lt;/a&gt; is in this context. I'm
guessing the &amp;quot;java to gen html&amp;quot; is
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vorburger/JRst/blob/master/jrst/doc/en/index.rst"&gt;JRst&lt;/a&gt;.
The lack of clarity is, of course, part of the problem here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This requirement surfaced in the context of explaining to me why
Windows was so important. Really. Windows was required to run two
open-source apps. And. &amp;quot;a windows machine is not the way to go.&amp;quot;
Doomed. To. Inevitable. Failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the only relevant functional requirement(s): run Leo and Java.
And even then, there's a huge hole in this. Leo is Python-based.
Docutils RST2HTML is Python-based. Why not simply use Leo and Python?
What does Java have to do with anything?
Buy this: a Pi-top: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13896"&gt;https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13896&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="q2-are-there-issues-w-running"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q2. Are there issues w/ running...?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Always. For everything you can possibly enumerate there are
&amp;quot;issues&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There. Are. Always. Issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use Cases Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you don't have any functional requirements or use cases, it's
impossible to filter the issues and see if any of the known issues
impact what you think you're going to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I was told, a Pi-top covers everything that's &lt;strong&gt;required&lt;/strong&gt;.
It's hard to be sure, of course, when the functional requirements are
so vague. But there's no evidence that the Pi-top can't work to fill
&lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; of the stated functional requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-to-do-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What To Do Next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems obvious, but the next step is to create a test plan.
Actually, that was the first step. Since it wasn't done first, now
it's the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write down the things you want to &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt;. Make a list. Ideally a long
list of things you will &lt;strong&gt;DO&lt;/strong&gt;. Active voice. &lt;strong&gt;Verbs&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Actions&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;strong&gt;Tasks&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Activities&lt;/strong&gt;. It's hard to emphasize this enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, when considering a computer, see if it can actually do those
things. Test it against the requirements to see if it does what it's
supposed to do. Among all the machines that pass the tests, you can
then sort by price. (Or availability, or reputation, or cool
stickers, whatever non-functional requirements seem relevant.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions of Tb and Mb and processor clock speed mean nothing.
Nothing. Find the cheapest (smallest) machine that does what you
want. Don't find the machine with xMb and yTb of whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There there's this, &amp;quot;As I get more serious about this data science
stuff&amp;quot; which seems little more than context. But it's really
important. Indeed, it's &lt;strong&gt;essential&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're going to &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; machine learning, you don't really want to
&lt;strong&gt;buy&lt;/strong&gt; the necessary computer. You want to rent it for the hour or
so each day you actually need it. It will be idle 23/24 hours each
day (96% of the time.) Why buy that much horsepower which you are
never going to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're going to login to a server you purchased from a cloud
computing vendor. Amazon AWS. Microsoft Azure, etc., then, you can
probably get by with a tablet that runs SSH and a browser. A tablet
with a cool keyboard and a little display rack can be very
nice. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://panic.com/prompt/"&gt;https://panic.com/prompt/&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.termius.com/"&gt;https://www.termius.com&lt;/a&gt;
seem to be all that's required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/"&gt;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.brydgekeyboards.com/"&gt;https://www.brydgekeyboards.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Use Cases, however, it's impossible to select a computer.
Don't spend money without test cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

up over and over. A good place to start is the wiki article “&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality"&gt;curse
of
dimensionality&lt;/a&gt;.”
The issue seems to be that a lot of these big data / data science
people have not taken the time to study fundamental data structures.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was more about &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Multidimensional-Structures-Kaufmann-Computer/dp/0123694469"&gt;Foundations of Multidimensional and Metric Data
Structures&lt;/a&gt;
by Hanan Samet being too detailed. And Stack Overflow being too
high-level.  And more hand-wringing after that, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email was pleading for some book or series of blog posts that
would somehow educate data science folks on more fundamental issues of
data structures and algorithms. Perhaps getting them to drop some
dimensions when doing k-NN problems or perhaps exploit some other data
structure that didn't involve 100's of columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm guessing because -- like a lot of hand-waving emails -- it didn't
involve code. And yes, I'm very bigoted about the distinction between
code and hand-waving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a lack of awareness of appropriate data structures, the
real place to start is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.algorist.com/"&gt;The Algorithm Design
Manual&lt;/a&gt; by Steven Skiena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I harbor my doubts that this is the real problem, however. I think
that the broad spectrum of computing applications leads to a lot of
specialization. I don't think that it's really prudent to try and
think of generalists who can handle deep data science issues as well
as algorithm design and performance issues. No one expects them to
write JavaScript and tinker with CSS so that the web site which
presents the results looks good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually think the real problem is that some folks expect too much
from their data scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fantasy land the rock stars are full stack developers who can span
the entire spectrum from OS to CSS. In the real world, developers have
different strengths and interests. In some cases, &amp;quot;full stack&amp;quot; means
mediocre skills in a lot of areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a more useful response: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/packt-publishing/bridging-the-gap-between-data-science-and-devops-93285ca07cf0#.68q5nf3za"&gt;Bridging the Gap Between Data Science
and
DevOps&lt;/a&gt;.
I don't think the problem is &amp;quot;big data / data science people have not
taken the time to study fundamental data structures&amp;quot;. I think the
problem is that big data is a cooperative venture. It takes a team to
solve a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;rant&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not a fan of applying TDD in a strict, death-march fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see the comments on Stack Overflow that indicate that some folks
feel strongly that strict TDD is somehow helpful. While &amp;quot;test before
code&amp;quot; is laudable and often helpful, there's no royal road to good
software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design involves a great deal of back and forth between code and test.
A great deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's logically impossible to write a test without having thought about
the code. In order to write the test first, there &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be a
notional API against which the test is written. Anyone who requires
that the test file must be written before the notional class or module
is just playing at petty tyranny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notional design -- the rough outline of the class or module -- can
be written into a file before any tests. It's okay. It is still
test-driven because the considerations of testability drove the design
process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, when starting &amp;quot;from scratch&amp;quot; -- with nothing -- writing
tests first is senseless. Some module or package structure must exist
for the test modules to import.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/rant&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having ranted, it still arises that the tests do come before any code
under some circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the requested functionality was quite difficult to
visualize. However, it was possible to cobble together a test case
that simplified the problem down to something like this this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
01 Some-Record.
    05 Header PIC XXX.
    05 Body PIC X(17).

01 ABC-Segment.
    05 Field-ABC PIC X(17).

01 DEF-Segment.
    05 Field-DEF PIC X(17).
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In COBOL, the program would use logic like IF Header EQUALS &amp;quot;ABC&amp;quot; THEN
MOVE Body TO ABC-Segment. We need a way to handle something like this
in Python so that we can parse the EBCDIC COBOL data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summarized example allowed construction of a test case that made
use of a API that might have existed. I was pretty sure I had a test
case that showed an approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-actually-happened"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Actually Happened&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the application already had 178 unit tests, there was plenty of
structure that worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single new unit test relied on a notional API that wasn't really
in place. The new test bombed grotesquely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two solutions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify the test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix the notional API so that it works properly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started out chasing the second option. I tweaked some things. More
tests failed. I tweaked some more things. The new test finally passed,
but another test was failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some careful study of the failing test revealed that my approach was
wrong. Way wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notional API was a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tweaks to make it work were a worse idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="back-to-the-lab-bench"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Back to the Lab Bench&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I had made enough changes that the only thing to do was
copy the new test and use the Git Revoke on the local changes to
unwind the awful mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staring again, I had a slightly better grip on the relevant code. I
had a failing test. I tried a different approach that wasn't quite so
inventive. This meant modifying the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually went through a few iterations of the test, using the test
method as a kind of lab bench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more Pythonic approach to the lab bench is to work from the &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
prompt. I think that &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; of the exemplary projects use the &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
prompt examples in their documentation. This is a way to narrow and
clarify the API. As projects get big, they can sprawl. New features
can wind up with many imports to pick and choose elements from
existing modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it becomes difficult to use the &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; prompt as the lab bench,
that's a sign that the API is too complex. Refactoring must happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the unit test framework as the lab bench was a hint that
something had drifted out of tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However. I did get a test which passed. Yay. Sort of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test code was hideous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tdd-and-api-design"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TDD and API Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of TDD, however, is that we have a working suite of tests.
Refactoring won't break anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point was that the hideous API could be rewritten into something
that both&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passed all the tests, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was usable at the &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; prompt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's difficult to express how valuable the Python &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; prompt is to
help clarify API design issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;If the API doesn't make sense at the &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; prompt, it's incomprehensible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, Java doesn't have this kind of boundary. Java programming can
spin into quite complex API's, limited only by the laziness of the
programmer who avoids refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the malice of the programmer's manager in not allowing time to
refactor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

worked with the users to gather test cases. And I rewrote their legacy
app using Test-Driven Development. The legacy C code was more a hint
than anything else.
I thought it went well. We uncovered some issues in the test cases.
Uncovered a known issue in the legacy program. And added new features.
All very nice. A solid success.
Years later, a developer from the organization had to make some more
changes.
The client calls.
&amp;quot;No problem,&amp;quot; I assure them, &amp;quot;I'm happy to answer any questions. With
one provision. Questions have to be about specific code. I can't do
'overview' questions. Email me the code snippet and the question.&amp;quot;
I never heard another word.  No question of any kind. Not a general
question (that I find difficult to answer,) nor a specific question.
Why the provision?
I find it very hard to talk with someone who hasn't actually read the
code yet. I have done far too many presentations to people who are
sitting around a conference room table, nodding and looking at
power-point slides.
I know the initial phone call focused on &amp;quot;an overview.&amp;quot; But what counts
as an overview? Use cases? Data model? Architectural layers? Test cases?
Rather than waste time explaining something irrelevant, I figured if
they asked anything -- anything at all -- I could focus on what they
really wanted to know.
I know that I have never been able to understand people hand-waving at a
picture of code. I have to actually read the code to see what the
modules, classes and functions are and how they seem to work. I'm
suspicious of graphics and diagrams.  I know that I can't read the code
while someone is talking. If they insist on talking, I need to read the
code in advance.
Perhaps I'm imposing too much on this customer. But. They're going to
maintain the code -- that seems to mean they need to understand it. And
they need to understand it their own way, without my babbling randomly
about the bits that interested me. Maybe the part I found confusing is
obvious to them, and doesn't bear repeating.
Perhaps raising the bar to &amp;quot;specific questions about specific code&amp;quot;
forced them to read enough. Perhaps after some reading, they realized
they didn't need to pay me to explain things. I certainly can't brag
that the code explained itself.
Or. Perhaps they realized how the unit tests worked and realized that
TestCases provide a roadmap of the API.&lt;/p&gt;

context may have been a justification of the wild success of Windows
3.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, I could be just making it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one thing I have noticed is that there's a definite bias toward
looking at software three times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked (briefly) with an agile project management group that
suggested that everything will be released three times, called the
&amp;quot;Good&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Better&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Best&amp;quot; releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The good release passed the unit tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The better release included any non-functional (performance, auditability, maintainability, etc.) improvements required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best implementation possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everything required three releases. Simpler components can merge
better and best. Some components simply start out in really, really
good shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="teaching-moment"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Teaching Moment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I've also noticed is that the explanation of the component --
writing documentation, presenting to peers in a walkthrough -- leads
to profound rethinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May things may appear to be better or best in the sense above. Until
we have to explain them. Then they're no longer &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; but merely
&amp;quot;better&amp;quot; or perhaps even &amp;quot;good.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes spent hand-waving through a design often points to
things that aren't quite to easy to explain. A walkthrough is very
beneficial to the person doing the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, not too early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I made military software, we had Preliminary Design Reviews that
were done before coding begins. The idea was to surround the
difficult coding work with yet more process steps and yet more
deliverable intermediate results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intent was noble: if a walkthrough reveals so much, then do the
walkthroughs early and often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However. I'm beginning to think that early isn't ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the design walkthrough should be delayed until after
minimally working code exists. Once there's code -- with automated
unit tests -- then refactoring to meet non-functional quality factors
(like performance) is easier and more likely to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, refactoring to make the software clear, simple, and elegant
should probably wait until it works and has a complete suite of
automated unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Very clever stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was described as horribly slow. Since it was only 400 lines of
code, it was a great subject for review in a Python meetup.  I would
be able to show some tweaks and performance tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hypothetical-step-1-profile"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hypothetical Step 1:  Profile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought was to run the profiler and see what popped up as a
possible root cause of slowness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, there are three kinds of performance problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrong data structure&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Or wrong algorithm.  (They're simply
opposite sides of the same coin.)  This generally leads to dramatic,
earth-shattering improvements.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Piss-Poor Programming Practices&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This kind of fine-tuning yields
minuscule improvements.  In some cases, no measurable change at all.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bugs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Every time I've been asked to improve &amp;quot;working&amp;quot; code, I
find that it has bugs.  Every time.  These can exacerbate performance
problems.  Interestingly, most of these are readily apparent during
an initial survey:  i.e., while simply reading the code to see how it
works.  Trying to create unit tests for the purposes of refactoring
often reveals additional bugs.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't know what I was going to see in this 400-line program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypothetically, profiling will help show what kind of problems we
have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to profiling, of course, we need to run the darn thing.
Thankfully, they provided some typical input files.  For example,
1979 High School Football season results.  159 lines of patiently
gathered teams and scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="it-didn-t-run"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It Didn't Run&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we tried to run it with the profiler, we found that we had a
bug.  Tracking down the bug, revealed the essential performance
problem, also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;core&lt;/em&gt; problem was a failure to make use of Python data
structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This manifested itself in a number of really bad design errors.
Plus, it presented as the actual, show-stopping, serious bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to work out team rankings, the program kept a list of teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll repeat that for folks who are skimming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;In order to work out team rankings, the program kept a list of teams.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a dict mapping from team name to team details.  But a simple
list.  Locating a team in the list meant iterating through the list,
looking for the matching team.  Really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
for t in team_list:
   if t['name'] == target_name:
       process( t )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of thing was repeated in more than one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one of those repeats had the bug in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we have here is &amp;quot;wrong data structure&amp;quot;.  Replacing a list with a
dict will have earth-shattering impact on performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-bug"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Bug&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bug, BTW, was a lookup loop which had the additional requirement
of adding missing teams.  It tried to use the &lt;strong&gt;for-else&lt;/strong&gt; structure.
This was the intended code (not the actual code).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
for t in team_list:
   if t['name'] == target_name:
else:
   t['name']= init_new_team(target_name)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a first-class bit of Python.  An &lt;strong&gt;else&lt;/strong&gt; clause on a &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt;
statement is a real feature of the language.  However, it's obscure
enough that it's easy to get wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it's also unique to Python, and the kind of thing that can
lead to confusion.  I discourage it's use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="test-driven-reverse-engineering"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Test-Driven Reverse Engineering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're doing TDRE on a little piece of recreational programming.  This
means that we need to fabricate unit tests for code that is purported
to work.  Some folks like to call this &amp;quot;exploratory testing&amp;quot; (a
phrase which is contradictory, and consequently meaningless.)  We're
&amp;quot;exploring&amp;quot;.  We're not &amp;quot;testing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the core bug is fixed, we can run sample data through the
application to get &amp;quot;big picture&amp;quot; results.  We can extract bits from
the sample data and exercise various functions in isolation to
determine what they actually do now, bugs included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is so simple--and we're going to review it during a 2-hour
meet up--and there's nothing billable going on--we can get by with a
few really simple unit tests.  We'll run the darn thing once to
create some expected output.  We save the output and use that single
output log as the expected results from each refactoring step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More complex applications require more unit tests.  For a billable
TDRE effort last year, I had to create 122 unit tests to successfully
refactor a program of over 6,000 lines of code.  It took several
weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="real-step-1-fix-the-data-structure"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Real Step 1: Fix The Data Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before profiling (but after running to capture some output) we have
to fix the essential data structure.  Repeated scanning of a list is
never going to perform well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole point of the study of &amp;quot;Data Structures&amp;quot; is to prevent (or
optimize) search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, we can prevent linear search of a list by using a
dictionary.  That, clearly, is job one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a pervasive rewrite.   Essentially, everything in this little
program included a goofy loop to lookup a team in the list.  The Elo
algorithm itself, which is already &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;span class="textbf"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, is dragged
down by using the linear search for the opposing team four more
times, making it &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;span class="textbf"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="cyclomatic-complexity"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cyclomatic Complexity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big &amp;quot;issues&amp;quot; is the use of &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; statements throughout
the scoring algorithm.  An &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; statement creates &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity"&gt;Cyclomatic
Complexity&lt;/a&gt;
and can lead to performance problems.  Generally, &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; statements
should be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This algorithm applies some normalization factors to reconcile
scoring with win/loss numbers in different sports.  Basketball,
specifically, involves generally high scores.  Since there are
2-point and 3-point scoring opportunities, a factor is used to
normalize the points into &amp;quot;goals&amp;quot;.  Football, similarly, has numerous
scoring opportunities with values of 1, 2, 3 and 6 points; the scores
here are also normalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This normalization was done with an &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; statement that was
evaluated deep inside the Elo algorithm.  Repeatedly. Evaluated.
The two functions that handled the normalizations, plus the
normalization factors, are ideal candidates for OO design.  There's a
clear hierarchy of classes here.  A superclass handles most sports,
and two polymorphic subclasses handle football and basketball
normalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; statement is now &amp;quot;pushed up&amp;quot; to the very beginning of the
program where an instance of the sports normalization object is
created.  This object's methods are then used by the Elo algorithm to
normalize scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="icing-on-the-cake"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Icing on the Cake&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we've fixed the bug and replaced a list with a dict, everything
else is merely icing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other OO changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;quot;Team&amp;quot; information should not be a flat, anonymous dictionary.
It should be a proper class definition with proper attributes.
There aren't many methods, so it's easy to create.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;quot;Game&amp;quot; information is read by csv.DictReader.  However, it
should not remain a simple, anonymous dict.  As with a Team, a
simple class can be created to handle Game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The overall structure of the application needs to be broken into
two sections.  The command-line interface parses options, opens
files, and generally gets everything set up.  The actual ranking
algorithm should be a function that is given an open file-like
object plus the Sport object for normalization.  This allows the
ranking algorithm to be reused in other contexts than the
command-line (i.e. a web service).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more subtle OO design point is the question of &amp;quot;mutability&amp;quot;.  A
Team in this application is little more than a name.   There are
also numerous &amp;quot;stateful&amp;quot; values that are part of the Elo
algorithm.   A Game, similarly, is an immutable pair of teams and
scores.  However, it has some mutable values that are part of the
Elo algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, we have immutable Team and GameHistory objects, plus a few
values that are used as part of the Elo calculation.  I'm a big
fan of disentangling these mutable and immutable objects from each
other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that the Elo algorithm doesn't &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need to update
the &amp;quot;state&amp;quot; of an object.  I suspect that it actually creates (and
discards) a number of immutable candidate ranking objects.  The
iteration that leads to convergence might be a matter of object
creation rather than update.  I didn't make this change, since it
required real work and we were out of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bottom-line"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more times I do TDRE to improve performance, the more I
realize that it's all about bugs and data structures.
This recreational application took 45-60 seconds to process one
year's record of games for a given league.  It now takes less than
0.2 seconds to do the same volume of work.  Two test cases
involving a complete run of 159 records runs in 0.411 seconds.
That's 1/100th the time simply from switching data structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of &amp;quot;tweaking&amp;quot; a working program to improve performance is
generally misleading.  It might happen, but the impact is
minuscule at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the checklist for getting 100:1 improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove searches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove deeply-nested &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; statements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, reduce Cyclomatic Complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;First, read this.    &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/08/passwords-under-assault/"&gt;Why passwords have never been weaker—and

&lt;div class="line"&gt;There are numerous important lessons in this article.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;First, read this.    &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/08/passwords-under-assault/"&gt;Why passwords have never been weaker—and
crackers have never been
stronger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;There are numerous important lessons in this article.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;One of the small lessons is that changing your password every sixty or
ninety days is farcical.  The rainbow table algorithms can crack a
badly-done password in minutes.  Every 60 days, the cracker has to
spend a few minutes breaking your new password.  Why bother changing
it?  It only annoys the haxorz; they'll be using your account within a
few minutes.  However.  That practice is now so ingrained that it's
difficult to dislodge from the heads of security consultants.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The big lesson, however, is profound.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Recently, I got a request from a developer on how to encrypt a
password.  We have a Python back-end and the developer was asking
which crypto package to download and how to install it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;quot;Crypto?&amp;quot; I asked.  &amp;quot;Why do we need crypto?&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;quot;To encrypt passwords,&amp;quot; they replied.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I spat coffee on my monitor.  I felt like hitting Caps Lock in the
chat window so I could respond like this: &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;NEVER ENCRYPT A PASSWORD,
YOU DOLT&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I didn't, but I felt like it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Much Confusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The conversation took hours.  Chat can be slow that way.  Also, I can
be slow because I need to understand what's going on before I reply.
 I'm a slow thinker.  But the developer also needed to try stuff and
provide concrete code examples, which takes time.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;At the time, I knew that passwords must be hashed with salt.  I hadn't
read the Ars Technica article cited above, so I didn't know why
computationally intensive hash algorithms are best for this.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;We had to discuss hash algorithms.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;We had to discuss algorithms for generating unique salt.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;We had to discuss random number generators and how to use an entropy
source for a seed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;We had to discuss &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt"&gt;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt&lt;/a&gt; in some depth,
since the algorithms in section 3.2.2. show some best practices in
creating hash summaries of usernames, passwords, and realms.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;All of this was, of course, side topics before we got to the heart of
the matter.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's Been Going On&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;After several hours, my &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; questions started revealing things.  The
specific user story, for example, was slow to surface.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Why?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Partly because I didn't demand it early enough.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;But also, many technology folks will conceive of a &amp;quot;solution&amp;quot; and
pursue that technical concept no matter how difficult or bizarre.  In
some cases, the concept doesn't really solve the problem.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I call this the &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.itmaybeahack.com/homepage/iblog/architecture/C412398194/E20060223203608/index.html"&gt;Rat Holes of Lost
Time&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;
phenomena: we chase some concept through numerous little rat-holes
before we realize there's a lot of activity but no tangible progress.
 There's a perceptual narrowing that occurs when we focus on the
technology.  Often, we're not actually solving the problem.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
IT people leap past the problem into the solution as naturally as
they breathe. It's a hard habit to break.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;It turned out that they were creating some additional RESTful web
services.  They knew that the RESTful requests needed proper
authentication.  But, they were vague on the details of how to secure
the new RESTful services.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;So they were chasing down their concept: encrypt a password and
provide this encrypted password with each request.  They were half
right, here.  A secure &amp;quot;token&amp;quot; is required.  But an encrypted password
is a terrible token.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use The Framework, Luke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;What's most disturbing about this is the developer's blind spot.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For some reason, the existence of other web services didn't enter into
this developer's head.  Why didn't they read the code for the services
created on earlier sprints?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;We're using Django.  We already have a RESTful web services framework
with a complete (and high quality) security implementation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Nothing more is required.  Use the RESTful authentication already part
of Django.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;In most cases, HTTPS is used to encrypt at the socket layer.  This
means that Basic Authentication is all that's required.  This is a
huge simplification, since all the RESTful frameworks already offer
this.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The Django Rest Framework has a nice
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django-rest-framework.org/library/authentication.html"&gt;authentication&lt;/a&gt;
module.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;When using
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/jespern/django-piston/wiki/Documentation#!authentication"&gt;Piston&lt;/a&gt;,
it's easy to work with their Authentication handler.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;It's possible to make RESTful requests with Digest Authentication, if
SSL is not being used.  For
example, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/akoha/django-digest/wiki/Home"&gt;Akoha&lt;/a&gt; handles
this.  It's easy to extend a framework to add Digest in addition to
Basic authentication.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;For other customers, I created an authentication handler between
Piston and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.forgerock.com/openam.html"&gt;ForgeRock
OpenAM&lt;/a&gt; so that OpenAM tokens
were used with each RESTful request.  (This requires some care to
create a solution that is testable.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Lines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Don't encrypt passwords.  Ever.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Don't write your own hash and salt algorithm.  Use a framework that
offers this to you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Read the Ars Technica article before doing anything password-related.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="no-quot-don-39-t-encrypt-passwords-ever-quo"&gt;

anything.&lt;/p&gt;

that Basic Authentication is all that's required&amp;quot;

migration), I received information from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bphx.com/"&gt;Blue
Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; about their approach to modernization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before talking about modernization, it's important to think about the
following issue from two points of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Modernization can amount to nothing more than &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1769710/change-management-paving-cowpaths"&gt;Paving the
Cowpaths&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After talking about some experience with legacy modernization (or
migration), I received information from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bphx.com/"&gt;Blue
Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; about their approach to modernization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before talking about modernization, it's important to think about the
following issue from two points of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Modernization can amount to nothing more than &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1769710/change-management-paving-cowpaths"&gt;Paving the
Cowpaths&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a user viewpoint, &amp;quot;paving the cowpaths&amp;quot; means that the legacy
usability issues have now been modernized without being fixed. The
issues remain. A dumb business process is now implemented in a modern
programming language. It's still a dumb business process. The
modernization was strictly technical with no user-focused &amp;quot;value-add&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a technical viewpoint, &amp;quot;paving the cowpaths&amp;quot; means that bad
legacy design, bad legacy implementation and legacy platform quirks
have now been modernized. A poorly-designed application in a legacy
language has been modernized into a poorly-designed application in yet
another language. Because of language differences, it may go from
poorly-designed to really-poorly-designed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real underlying issue is how to avoid low-value modernization. How
to avoid merely converting bad design and bad UX from one language to
another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider that it's possible to actually &lt;strong&gt;reduce&lt;/strong&gt; the value of a
legacy application through poorly-planned modernization. Converting
quirks and bad design from one language to another will not magically
make a legacy application &amp;quot;better&amp;quot;. Converting quirky code to Java
will merely canonize the quirks, obscuring the essential business
value that was also encoded in the quirky legacy code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="focus-on-value"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Focus on Value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental modernization question is &amp;quot;Where's the Value?&amp;quot; Or,
more specifically, &amp;quot;What part of this legacy is worth preserving?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, it's not even completely clear what the legacy software
really is. Old COBOL mainframe systems may contain hundreds (or
thousands) of application programs, each of which does some very small
thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &amp;quot;Focus on Value&amp;quot; is essential, it's not clear how one achieves
this. Here's a process I've used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="step-1-create-a-code-and-data-inventory"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1. Create a code and data inventory.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is essential for determine what parts of the legacy system have
value. Blue Phoenix has &amp;quot;Legacy Indexing&amp;quot; for determine the current
state of the application portfolio. Bravo. This is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've done this analysis with Python. It's not difficult. Many
organizations can provide a ZIP file with all of the legacy source and
and all of the legacy JCL (Z/OS shell scripts). A few days of scanning
can produce inventory summaries showing programs, files, inputs and
outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A suite of tools would probably be simpler than writing a JCL parser
in Python&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large commercial operation will have all kinds of source checked
into the repository. Some will be inexplicable. Some will have never
been used. In some cases, there will be executable code that was
&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; actually built from the source in the master source
repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recreational project (like HamCalc) reveals the same patterns of
confusion as large multi-million dollar efforts. There are mystery
programs which are probably never used; the code is available, but
they don't appear in shell scripts or interactive menus. There are
programs which have clear bugs and (apparently) never worked. There
are programs with quirks; programs that work because of an
undocumented &amp;quot;feature&amp;quot; of the language or platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="step-2-capture-the-data"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2. Capture the Data.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases, the data is central: the legacy files or databases need
to be preserved. The application code is often secondary. In &lt;strong&gt;most&lt;/strong&gt;
cases, the application code is almost worthless, and only the data
matters. The application programs serve only as a definition of how to
interpret and decode the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue Phoenix has Transition Bridge Services. Bravo. You'll be moving
data from legacy to new (and the reverse, also.) We'll return to this
&amp;quot;Build Bridges&amp;quot; below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the data vs. application programming distinction, I need to
repeat my observation: Legacy Code Is Largely Worthless. Some folks
are married to legacy application code. The legacy code does stuff to
the legacy files. It &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be important, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That's simple logic, you idiot,&amp;quot; they say to me. &amp;quot;It's only logical
that we need to preserve all the code to process all the data.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's actually false. It's not simple logic. It's just wishful
thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you actually read legacy code, you find that a significant
fraction (something like 30%) is trivial recapitulation of SQL's &amp;quot;set&amp;quot;
operations: SQL DML statements have an implied loop that operates on a
set of data. Large amounts of legacy code merely recapitulates the
implied loop. This is trivially true of legacy SQL applications with
embedded SQL; explicit FETCH loops are very wordy. There's no sense in
preserving this overhead if it can be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programs which work with flat files always have long stretches of code
that models SQL loops or Map-Reduce loops. There's no value in the
loop management parts of these programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another significant fraction is &amp;quot;utility&amp;quot; code that is not
application-specific in any way. It's an application program that
merely does a &amp;quot;CREATE TABLE XYZ(...) AS SELECT ....&amp;quot;: a single line of
SQL. There's no sense in preserving this through an &amp;quot;automated&amp;quot; tool,
since it doesn't really do anything of value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also. The legacy code has usability issues. It doesn't precisely fit
the business use cases. (Indeed, it probably hasn't fit the business
use cases for decades.) Some parts of the legacy code base are more
liability than asset and should be discarded in order to simplify,
streamline or improve operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's left?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high value processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="step-3-extract-the-business-rules"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3. Extract the Business Rules.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we've disposed of overheads, utility code, quirks, bad design,
and wrong use cases, what's left are a the real brass tacks. A few
lines of code here and there will decode a one-character flag or
indicator and determine the processing. This code is of value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this code will be disappointingly small compared to the
total inventory. It will often be widely scattered. Bad copy-and-paste
programming will lead to exact copies as well as near-miss copies. It
may be opaque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
IF FLAG-2 IS &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; THEN MOVE &amp;quot;R&amp;quot; TO FLAG-BC.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously. What does this mean? This may turn out to be the secret
behind paying bonus commissions to highly-valued sales associates. If
this isn't preserved, the good folks will all quit &lt;em&gt;en masse&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the &amp;quot;Business Rules&amp;quot; layer of a modern application design.
These are the nuggets of high-value coding that we need to preserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are things that must be redesigned when moving from the old
database (or flat files) to the new database. These one character flag
fields should not simply be preserved as a single character. They need
to be &lt;strong&gt;understood&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business rules should &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; be subject to automated
translation. These bits of business-specific processing must
&lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; be reviewed by the users (or business owners) to be
absolutely sure that it's (a) relevant and (b) has a complete suite of
unit test cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unique processing rules need to have modern, formal documentation.
Minimally, the documentation must be in the form of unit test cases;
English as a backup can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="step-4-build-bridges"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 4. Build Bridges.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A modernization project is not a once-and-done operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been told that the IT department goal is to pick a long weekend,
preferably a federal Monday holiday weekend (Labor Day is always
popular), and do a massive one-time-only conversion on that weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a terrible plan. It is doomed to failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better plan is a phased coexistence. If a vendor (like Blue Phoenix)
offers bridge services, then it's smarter and less risky to convert
back and forth between legacy and new over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy is to convert early and convert often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good plan is the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modernize some set of features in the legacy quagmire of code. This
should be a simple rewrite from scratch using the legacy code as a
specification and the legacy files (or database) as an interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run in parallel to be sure the modern version works. Do &lt;strong&gt;frequent&lt;/strong&gt;
data conversions from old to new as part of this parallel test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At some point, simply stop converting from old to new and start using
the new because it passes all the tests. Often, the new will have
additional features or remove old bugs, so the users will be
clamoring for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For particularly large and gnarly systems, all features cannot be
modernized at once. There will be features that have not yet been
modernized. This means that some portion of new data will be
converted back to the legacy for processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature sets are prioritized by value. What's most important to
the users? As each feature set is modernized, the remaining bits
become less and less valuable. As some point, you get to the
situation where you have a portfolio of unconverted code but no
missing features. Since there are no more desirable legacy features
to convert, the remaining code is -- by definition -- worthless.
The unconverted code is a net cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="automated-translation"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Automated Translation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that there is very little emphasis on automated translation of
legacy code. The important work is uncovering the data and the
processing rules that make the data usable. The important tools are
inventory tools and data bridging tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language survey tools will be helpful. Tools to look for file
operations. Tools to look for places where a particular field of a
record is used.
Automated translation will tend to pave &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; the cowpaths: good,
bad and indifferent. Once the good features are located, a manual
rewrite is just as efficient as automated translation.
Automated translation cannot capture meaning, identify use cases or
write unit test cases. Thoughtful manual analysis of meaning,
usability and unit tests is how the value of legacy code and data is
preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;Good&amp;quot; is defined as a nice simple and intuitive GUI interface. I
would be able to just pick symbol from a pallette and put it
somewhere and the software would automatically adjust the spacing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noise words&lt;/strong&gt;.  Phrases like &amp;quot;'Good' is defined as&amp;quot; don't
provide any meaning.  The word &amp;quot;just&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;automatically&amp;quot; are
approximately useless.  Here is the two-step test for noise words.&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the word and see if the meaning changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put the opposite and see if the meaning changed.  If you can't find a
simple opposite, it's noise of some kind.  Often it's an empty
tautology, but sometimes it's platitudinous buzzwords.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Untestable requirements&lt;/strong&gt;.  &amp;quot;nice, simple and intuitive&amp;quot; are
unqualified and possible untestable.  If it's untestable, then
everything meets the criteria (or nothing does.)  Elegant.  State
of the art.  Again, apply the reverse test:  try &amp;quot;horrid, complex
and counter-intuitive&amp;quot; and see if you can find that component.
No?  Then it's untestable and has no place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silliness&lt;/strong&gt;.  &amp;quot;GUI&amp;quot;.  It's 2012.  What non-GUI interfaces are
left?  Oh right.  The GNU/Linux command line.  Apply the reverse
test: try &amp;quot;non-GUI&amp;quot; and see if you can even locate a product.
Can't find the opposite?  Don't waste time writing it down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's left?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
pick symbol from a palette ... the software would ... adjust the
spacing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it.  That's the requirement.  35 words that mean &amp;quot;Drag-n-Drop
equation editing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have other issues with requirements this poorly done.  One of my
standard complaints is that no one has actually talked to actual
users about their actual use cases.  In this case, I happen to know
that the user did provide input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings up another important suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't listen to the users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By that I mean &amp;quot;Don't &lt;strong&gt;passively&lt;/strong&gt; listen to the users &lt;strong&gt;and
blindly write down all the words they use&lt;/strong&gt;.  They're often
uninformed.&amp;quot;  It's important to &lt;strong&gt;understand&lt;/strong&gt; what they're
talking about.  The best way to do this is to actually do their
job briefly.  It's also important to provide demos, samples,
mock-ups, prototypes or concrete examples.  It's 2012.  These
things are inexpensive nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the olden days we used to carefully write down all the users
words because it would take months to locate a module, negotiate a
contract, take delivery, install, customize, integrate, configure
and debug.  With that kind of overhead, all we could do was write
down the words and hope we had a mutual understanding of the use
case.  [That's a big reason for Agile methods, BTW:  writing down
all the user's words and hoping just doesn't work.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, you should be able to download, install and play with
candidate modules in &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; time than it takes to write down all
the user's words.  Often &lt;em&gt;much less&lt;/em&gt; time.  In some cases, you can
install something that works before you can get the users to
schedule a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that leads to another important suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't fantasize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some &amp;quot;Drag-n-Drop&amp;quot; requirements are simple fantasies that
ignore the underlying (and complex) semantic issues.  In this
specific example, equations aren't random piles of mathematical
symbols.  They're fairly complex and have an important semantic
structure.  Dragging a ∑ or a √ from a palette will be
unsatisfying because the symbol's semantics are &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; to
how it's placed in the final typeset equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've worked recently with some folks that are starting to look at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervideo"&gt;Hypervideo&lt;/a&gt;.  This is
often unpleasantly difficult to write requirements around because
it &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; like simple graphic tools would be all that's required.
A lesson learned from Hypertext editors (even good ones like
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/"&gt;XXE&lt;/a&gt;) is that &amp;quot;WYSIWYG&amp;quot;
doesn't apply to semantically rich markup.  There are nesting and
association relationships that are no fun to attempt to show
visually.  At some point, you just want to edit the XML and be
done with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Math typesetting is has deep semantics.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="ftp://ftp.ams.org/ams/doc/amsmath/short-math-guide.pdf"&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt;
captures that semantic richness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's often best to use something like
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pierre.chachatelier.fr/latexit/"&gt;LaTeXiT&lt;/a&gt; rather than
waste time struggling with finding a Drag-n-Drop tool that has
appropriate visual cues for the semantics.  The textual rules for
LaTeX are simple and—most importantly—fit the mathematical
meanings nicely.  It was invented by mathematicians for
mathematicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

True north (i.e., aligned with the grid on the chart) and Magnetic

&lt;p&gt;The essential use case here is &amp;quot;What's the compass variation at a
given point?&amp;quot;  The information is printed on paper charts, but it's
more useful to simply calculate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/models.shtml"&gt;magnetic
models&lt;/a&gt;: the US
Department of Defense World Magnetic Model (WMM) and the International
Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf.html"&gt;International
Geomagnetic Reference Field
(IGRF)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A packaged solution is geomag7.0.  This includes both the WMM and the
IGRF models.  This is quite complex.  However, it does have &amp;quot;sample
output&amp;quot;, which amount to unit test cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essential spherical harmonic model is available separately as a
small Fortran program,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf11.f"&gt;igrf11.f&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which leads us to reverse engineering this program into Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tdre-approach"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TDRE Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TDRE approach requires having some test cases to drive the reverse
engineering process toward some kind of useful results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geomag7.0 package includes two &amp;quot;Sample Output&amp;quot; files that have the
relevant unit test cases.  The file has column headings and 16 test
cases.  This leads us to the following outline for the unit test
application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
class Test_Geomag( unittest.TestCase ):
    def __init__( self, row ):
        super( Test_Geomag, self ).__init__()
        self.row= row
    def runTest( self ):
        row= self.row
        if details:
            print( &amp;quot;Source: {0:10s} {1} {2:7s} {3:10s} {4:10s} {5:5s} {6:5s}&amp;quot;.format( row['Date'], row['Coord-System'], row['Altitude'], row['Latitude'], row['Longitude'], row['D_deg'], row['D_min'] ),
            file=details )

        date= self.parse_date( row['Date'] )
        lat= self.parse_lat_lon( row['Latitude'] )
        lon= self.parse_lat_lon( row['Longitude'] )
        alt= self.parse_altitude(row['Altitude'] )

        x, y, z, f = igrf11syn( date, lat*math.pi/180, lon*math.pi/180, alt, coord=row['Coord-System'] )
        D = 180.0/math.pi*math.atan2(y, x) # Declination

        deg, min = deg2dm( D )

        if details:
            print( &amp;quot;Result: {0:10.5f} {1} K{2:&amp;lt;6.1f} {3:&amp;lt;10.3f} {4:&amp;lt;10.3f} {5:5s} {6:5s}&amp;quot;.format( date, row['Coord-System'], alt, lat, lon, str(deg)+&amp;quot;d&amp;quot;, str(min)+&amp;quot;m&amp;quot; ),
                file=details )
            print( file=details )

        self.assertEqual( row['D_deg'], &amp;quot;{0}d&amp;quot;.format(deg) )
        self.assertEqual( row['D_min'], &amp;quot;{0}m&amp;quot;.format(min) )

def suite():
    s= unittest.TestSuite()
    with open(sample_output,&amp;quot;r&amp;quot;) as expected:
        rdr= csv.DictReader( expected, delimiter=' ', skipinitialspace=True )
        for row in rdr:
            case= Test_Geomag( row )
            s.addTest( case )
    return s

r = unittest.TextTestRunner(sys.stdout)
result= r.run( suite() )
sys.exit(not result.wasSuccessful())
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Test_Geomag class does two things.  First, it parses the source
values to create a usable test case.  We've omitted the parsers to
reduce clutter.  Second, it produces details to help with debugging.
This is reverse engineering, and there's &lt;strong&gt;lots&lt;/strong&gt; of debugging.  It
depends on a global variable, details, which is either set to
sys.stderr or None.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suite() function builds a suite of test cases from the input
file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit under test isn't obvious, but there's a call to
the igrf11syn() function where the important work gets done.  We can
start with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
def  igrf11syn( date, nlat, elong, alt=0.0, coord='D' ):
   return None, None, None, None
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lets us run the tests and find that we have work to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="reverse-engineering"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reverse Engineering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IGRF11.F fortran code contains this IGRF11SYN &amp;quot;subroutine&amp;quot; that
does the work we want.  The geomag 7.0 package has a function called
shval3 which is essentially the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are implementations of the same underlying &amp;quot;13th order spherical
harmonic series&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;truncated series expansion&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fortran code contains numerous Fortran &amp;quot;optimizations&amp;quot;.  These are
irritating hackarounds because of actual (and perceived) limitations
of Fortran.  They fall into two broad classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hand Optimizations&lt;/strong&gt;.  All repeated expressions were manually
hoisted out of their context.  This is clever but makes the code
particularly obscure.  It doesn't help when local variables are named
ONE, TWO and THREE.  Bad is it is, not much needs to be done about
this.  Python code looks a bit like Fortran code, so very little
needs to be done except add `math.` to the various function calls
like sort, cos and sin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sparse Array Chicanery&lt;/strong&gt;.  There are actually two spherical
harmonic series.  The older 10-order and the new 13-order.   Each
model has two sets of coefficients: &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;.  These form two
half-matrices plus a vector.  The old models have 55 &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; values in
one matrix, 55 &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt; values in second matrix, and a set of 10 more &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;
values that form some kind of vector; 160 values.  The new models
have 91 g, 91 &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt; and 13 &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; in the extra vector; 195 values.  There
are 23 sets of these coefficients (for 1900, 1905, ... 2015).  The
&lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; case is 23×195=4,485 values.  This appears to be too much
memory, so the two matrices and vectors are optimized into a single
opaque collection of 3,256 numbers and delightfully complex set of
index calculations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 1.&lt;/strong&gt;  Do the smallest &amp;quot;literal&amp;quot; transformation of Fortran to
Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means things like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transforming the subroutine into a Python function with multiple return values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reasoning out the overall &amp;quot;steps&amp;quot;.  There's a bunch of setup followed by the essential series calculation followed by some final calculations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locating and populating the global variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reformatting the &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; statements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removing the GOTO's.  Either make them separate functions or properly nest the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reformatting the &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; loop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handling the 1-based indexing.  In almost all cases, Fortran &amp;quot;arrays&amp;quot; are best handled as Python dictionaries (&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; lists).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this is done, there are some remaining special-case
discrepancies.  Most of these are tacit assumptions about the
problem domain that turn out to be untrue.  For example, the
Geodetic, Geocentric features seemed needless.  However, they're
not handled trivially, and need to be left in place.  Also,
conversion of signed values in radians to degrees and minutes
isn't trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to passing all 16 unit tests with the single opaque
collection of 3,256 numbers and delightfully complex set of index
calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 2.&lt;/strong&gt;  Optimize so that it makes some sense in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This involves unwinding the index calculations to simplify the array.
The raw coefficients are available
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf11coeffs.txt"&gt;igrf11coeffs.txt&lt;/a&gt;)
and they have a sensible structure that separates the two matrices
very cleanly.  The code uses the combined matrix (called gh) in a
very few places.  The index calculations aren't obvious at all, but a
few calls to print reveal how the matrix is accessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given (1) unit tests that already work and (2) the pattern of access,
it's relatively easy to hypothesize a dictionary by year that
contains a pair of simple dictionaries, g[n,m] and h[n,m], for the
coefficients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="cleanup-and-packaging"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cleanup and Packaging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the tests pass, the package -- as a whole -- needs to be made
reasonably Pythonic.   In this case, it means a number of additional
changes.  For example, converting the API from degrees to radians,
supplying appropriate default values for parameters, providing
convenience functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there are Python ways to populate the coefficients
neatly and eliminate global variables.  In this case, it seemed
sensible to create a Callable class which could load the coefficients
during construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that there's little point in profiling to apply further
optimizations.  The legacy Fortran code was already meticulously hand
optimized.&lt;/p&gt;

did the following.  This isn't a genius move, but it's worth
emphasizing how important it is.  And what's most important isn't
technical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I built a simple &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SpikeSolution"&gt;spike solution&lt;/a&gt; to access their service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I morphed this into a &amp;quot;sanity check&amp;quot; to be sure that their service
really was working.  Mostly, I cleaned up the code so that it was
testable and deliverable without embarrassment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I morphed this into a &amp;quot;diagnostic tool&amp;quot; to bypass the higher-levels
of the application and simply access the vendor (and optionally dump
the results) to help determine what wasn't work.  This involved
adding the dump option to the sanity check and renaming the
command-line application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I morphed this into a &amp;quot;credentials check and diagnostic tool&amp;quot;.  This
was -- ahem -- merely taking the hard-wired credentials out of the
application.  Yes.  The first versions had hard-wired credentials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings us to the version in use today.  The &amp;quot;vendor ping&amp;quot;
application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default behavior is a credentials check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One optional behavior is to dump the interface details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another optional behavior is to allow selection among a small number
of simple interactions just to be sure things are working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="unplanned-work"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unplanned Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's important here isn't that I did all this.  What's important is
that the deliverables, user stories and project plans didn't include
this little nugget of high-value goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets run fairly frequently in crunch situations.  The actor in the
story (&amp;quot;As system admin...&amp;quot;) is rarely considered as a first-class
user of the application.  Yet, the admin is a first-class user, and
needs to have proper user stories for confirming that the application
is working properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three distinct things here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API definition - something we do all the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Defensive Programming&amp;quot; - something that may or may not actually exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paranoid Schizophrenic programming - a symptom of larger problems; this exists far too often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not that complicated, there's a simple 3-element
checklist for API design.  Unless &amp;quot;someone&amp;quot; is out to break
your API.   Whatever that means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A related topic is this kind of thing on Stack Overflow:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/261638/how-do-i-protect-python-code"&gt;How Do I Protect Python Code&lt;/a&gt;?
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/908285/secure-plugin-system-for-python-application"&gt;Secure Plugin System For Python
Application&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the Rules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we define an API for a module, we define some rules.
Failure to follow the rules is -- simply -- bad behavior.
And, just as simply, when someone breaks the API rules, the
module can't work.  Calling the API improperly is the as
same as trying to install and execute a binary on the wrong
platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the obligation of the designer to specify what will
happen when the rules are followed.  While it might be nice
to specify what will happen if the rules are not followed,
it is not an obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's my canonical example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
def sqrt( n ):
    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;sqrt(n) -&amp;gt; x such that x**2 == n, where n &amp;gt;= 0.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of what will happen is stated.  The
definition of what happens when you attempt sqrt(-1) is not
defined.  It would be nice if sqrt(-1) raises an exception,
and it would be nice to include that in the documentation,
but it isn't an obligation of the designer.  It's entirely
possible that sqrt(-1) could return 0.  Or (0+1j).  Or nan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Item one on the checklist: define what the function will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And note that there's a world of difference between failing,
and being used improperly.  We're talking about improper use
here; failure is unrelated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="complete-specification"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Complete Specification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I remind people that they are only obligated to specify
the correct behavior, some folks say &amp;quot;That's just wrong!  An
API document should specify every behavior!  You can't omit
the most important behavior -- the edge cases!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ummm... That position makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots and lots of situations unspecified in the API
documentation.  What about sqrt(2) when the underlying math
libraries are mis-installed?  What about sqrt(2) when the OS
has been corrupted by a virus in the math libraries?  What
about sqrt(2) when the floating-point processor has been
partially fried?  What about sqrt(2) when the floating-point
processor has been replaced by a nearly-equivalent
experimental chipset that doesn't raise exceptions properly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, there are an infinite number of situations not
specified in the API documentation.  For the most part,
there is only one situation defined in the API
documentation: the proper use.  All other situations may as
well be left unspecified.    Sometimes, a few additional
behaviors are specified, but only when those behaviors
provide value in diagnosing problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="diagnosing-problems"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diagnosing Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An API with thoughtful documentation will at least list the
exceptions that are most likely to be raised.  What's
important is that it does not include an exhaustive list of
exceptions.  Again, that's an absurd position -- why list
MemoryError on every single function definition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's important about things like exceptions and error
conditions is the diagnostic value of this information.  A
good designer will provide some diagnostic hints instead of
lots of words covering every &amp;quot;possible&amp;quot; case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there's no helpful diagnostic value, don't specify it.
For example, there's little good to be done by adding a
&amp;quot;Could raise MemoryError&amp;quot; on every method function
description.  It's true, but it isn't helpful.  Except in a
rare case of an API function that -- if used wrong -- will
raise a MemoryError; in this rare case you're providing
diagnostic information that can be helpful.  You are
overwriting the API, but you're being helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Item two on the checklist: provide diagnostic hints where
they're actually meaningful and helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="error-checking"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Error Checking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much error checking should our &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;sqrt()&lt;/tt&gt; function do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None?  Just fail to produce an answer, or perhaps throw an exception?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal.  This is easy to define, but many folks are unhappy with minimal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More than minimal but not everything.  This is troubling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything.  This is equally troubling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No error checking is easiest.  And it fits with our
philosophy.  If our sqrt function is used improperly --
i.e., someone broke the rule and provided a negative
number -- then any exception (or nan value) will
propagate to the caller and we're in good shape.  We
didn't overspecify -- we provided a wrong answer when
someone asked a wrong question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we're not talking about some failure to process
the data.  We're talking about being called in a
senseless way by a client that's not following the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a subtlety to this, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-non-math-example"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Non-Math Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I tried to use a postal scale to measure the
temperature in my oven.  The scale read 2.5 oz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked an ill-formed question.  I got something back.
It isn't an answer -- the question was ill-formed -- but
it looks like an answer.  It's a number where I expected
a number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's another one.  &amp;quot;Which is heavier, the number 7 or
the color green?&amp;quot;  Any answer (&amp;quot;7&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;splice
the main brace&amp;quot;) is valid when confronted with a question
like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I should have run a calibration (or &amp;quot;unit&amp;quot;) test
first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-termination-question"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Termination Question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of a function like square root, there is an
additional subtlety.  If we're using logarithms to
compute square root, our log function may raise an
exception for sqrt(-1) or it may return nan; either of
which work out well - an ill-formed question gets an
improper answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we might be using a search algorithm that will
fail to terminate (a bisection algorithm, or Newton's
method, for example.) Failure to terminate is a much,
much worse thing.  In this case -- and this case only --
we have to actually do some validation on the range of
inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Termination is undecidable by automated means.  It's a
design feature that we -- as programmers -- must assert
independently of any lint, compiler or testing
discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this is not &amp;quot;defensive programming&amp;quot;.  This is
ordinary algorithm design.  Every loop structure must
terminate.  If we're trying a simple bisection algorithm
and we have not bracketed a root properly (because, for
example, it's a complex number), the bisection won't
terminate.  A root-finding bisection algorithm must
actually do two two things to assure termination:  check
the range of the inputs and limit the number of
iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't defensive programming because we're not
checking that a mysterious &amp;quot;someone&amp;quot; is abusing the API.
We're asserting that our loop terminates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Item 3 on the checklist: reject values that would lead
loops to not terminate properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
def sqrt( n ):
    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;sqrt(n) -&amp;gt; x; such that x**2 == n; where n &amp;gt;= 0&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
    assert n &amp;gt;= 0
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="incorrect-error-checking"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Incorrect Error Checking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we start checking for loop termination, folks say
that &amp;quot;we're on a slippery slope&amp;quot; and ask where's that
&amp;quot;fine line&amp;quot; between the minimal level of error checking
(loops will terminate) and the
paranoid schizophrenic level of error checking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn't a slope.  It's a cliff.  Beyond loop
termination, there's (almost) nothing more that's
relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &amp;quot;almost&amp;quot;, I mean that languages like Python have a
tiny realm where an additional assertion about the
arguments is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of duck typing, many algorithms in Python can be
written very generically.  Very generically.  Sorting,
for example, can be applied to lists of -- almost --
anything.  Except, of course, it isn't meaningful for
things with no useful __cmp__ function.  And in the
case of things like a dictionary, what's the basis for
comparison?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language"&gt;dynamic
languages&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing"&gt;duck
typing&lt;/a&gt;,
it's possible that an algorithm will terminate, producing
a wrong answer.  (BTW, this one reason why Python has /
and // as distinct division operators -- to assure that
ints and floats can be used interchangeably and the
algorithm still works.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Item 4 on the checklist: When you have a known problem
with a type, reject only those types that are a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very rare, BTW.  Mostly it occurs with
overlapping types (lists and tuples, floats and ints.)
Most well-designed algorithms work with a wide variety
of types.  Except in the overlapping types situation,
Python will raise exceptions for types that don't work;
make use of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-about-business-rules"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What About &amp;quot;Business Rules&amp;quot;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &amp;quot;business rules&amp;quot; most people mean value ranges or
codes that are defined by some externality.  As in &amp;quot;the
claim value must be a number between the co-pay and the
life-time limit&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a &amp;quot;Defensive Programming&amp;quot; issue.  This is
just a policy statement written into the code.  Your API
won't break if the claim value is less than the co-pay.
Your users will be pissed off, but that's a separate
problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, you rarely raise an exception for business rules.
Usually, you'll collect business rule violations into a
formal error report or log.  For example, Django's
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/forms/validation/#ref-forms-validation"&gt;Forms&lt;/a&gt;
will collection a dictionary of validation errors.  Each
element in the dictionary has a list of problems with a
particular field on the form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-about-someone-who-can-t-use-the-api"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What About &amp;quot;Someone&amp;quot; Who Can't Use The API?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's where the conversation goes awry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, if this is a hypothetical &amp;quot;someone&amp;quot;, you need to
relax.  Consider these use cases. Are you worried that
&amp;quot;someone&amp;quot; will download your software, install it,
configures it, start to use it, and refuse to follow the
documented API?  Are you worried that they will send you
angry emails saying that they insist on doing the wrong
thing and your software doesn't work?  You don't need
&amp;quot;defensive programming&amp;quot;, you need to either add the
features they want or steer them to a package that does
what they're expecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's another version of a hypothetical someone: you're
working as part of a larger team, and you provide a
package with an API.  Are you worried that a team member
will refuse to follow the documented API?  Are you
worried that they will send you angry emails saying that
they insist on doing the wrong thing and your software
doesn't work?  This isn't a call for &amp;quot;defensive
programming,&amp;quot; this is a call for a conversation.  Perhaps
you built the wrong thing.  Perhaps you API documentation
isn't as crystal-clear as you thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="someone-really-is-using-it-wrong"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Someone Really Is Using It Wrong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common situation is someone who's actually using the
API wrong.  The conversation didn't help, they refuse to
change their software.  Or you can't easily call them out
on it because -- for example -- your boss wrote detailed
specs for you, which you followed, but someone else isn't
following.  What can you do?  The specification
contradicts the actual code that uses the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this a place where we can apply &amp;quot;Defensive
Programming&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a call for some diagnostic support.  You need
error messages and logs that help you diagnose the
problem and locate the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="root-causes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Root Causes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with &amp;quot;Defensive Programming&amp;quot; is that it
conflates two unrelated use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API Design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unwilling (or unable) to Follow Instructions. (UFI™)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;API design has four simple rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document what it does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For diagnostic aid, in common edge cases, document
other things it might do.  Specifically, describe
conditions that are root causes of exceptions or weird
answers.  Sometimes a subclass of exception is handy
for handling this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be sure that it terminates.  If necessary, validate
arguments to determine if termination can't happen and
raise exceptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In rare cases, check the data types to be sure the
algorithm will actually work.  Most of the time, wrong
data types will simply throw exceptions; leverage that
built-in behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If (1) someone refuses to follow the rules and (2)
complains that it's your API and (3) you elect to make
changes, then...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you can't prevent this.  There's no &amp;quot;defensive
programming&amp;quot; to head this off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, know that what you're doing is wrong.   Making
changes when someone else refuses to follow the rules
and blames you is enabling someone else's bad
behavior.  But, we'll assume you have to make changes
for external political reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third -- and most important -- you're relaxing the API
to tolerate ordinarily invalid data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="expanding-what-s-allowed"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Expanding What's &amp;quot;Allowed&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone refuses to follow the API -- and demands you
make a change -- you're having this conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Them: &amp;quot;I need you to 'handle' sqrt(-1).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You: &amp;quot;Square Root is undefined for negative numbers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Them: &amp;quot;I know that, but you need to 'handle' it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You: &amp;quot;There's no answer, you have to stop requesting sqrt(-1).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Them: &amp;quot;Can't change it.  I'm going to make sqrt(-1) requests for external political reasons.  I can't stop it, prevent it or even detect it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You: &amp;quot;What does 'handle' mean?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, they usually want you to do something that
lets them limp along.  Whatever they ask you to do is
crazy.  But you've elected to cover their erroneous code
in your module.  You're writing diagnostic code for their
problem, and you're burying it inside your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're going to do this, you're not doing &amp;quot;defensive
programming&amp;quot;, you're writing some unnecessary code that
diagnoses a problem elsewhere.  Label it this way and
make it stand out.  It isn't &amp;quot;defensive&amp;quot; programming.
It's &amp;quot;dysfunctional co-dependent relationship&amp;quot;
programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you mention it in the main list later, it becomes:
&amp;quot;In rare cases, check the data types to be sure the algorithm will
actually work. Most of the time, wrong data types will simply throw
exceptions; leverage that built-in behavior.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need t modify the first mention to something like
&amp;quot;Don't check argument types! (Except where you know a particular
data-type leads to a problem, where that data-type should then be
excluded rather than checking for a data-type that you know works
correctly)&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2009-06-01 15:07:12.399000-04:00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good analogy is in the world of electric appliances. Electronic
components like resistors, capacitors, transistors blow up if they are
hooked up wrong or too much voltage is put into them, yet no electronic
engineer says: “Gosh, these components are junk, let’s ask the supplier
to send us protected versions that withstand any kind of abuse”. A
component built that way would cost 5 times as much. What is actually
done is to look at the spec sheets for the components used and put them
together in such a way that they won’t blow up when you operate the
appliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2009-06-15 16:40:51.110000-04:00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not convinced. When I write defensive checks for, say, function
arguments, I'm guarding against someone (very probably me a few weeks
later) accidentally misusing an API. I'd rather know about that misuse
as soon as it happens, instead of later discovering that the numerical
results of all past year's calculations are suspect because somewhere we
took a square root of a negative number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again expensive rockets have been brought down by excessive error
handling (Ariane 5 Flight 501). I don't know where the line lies
exactly; but as long as program crashes aren't prohibitively expensive
I'd rather see a crash than garbage output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another case study on TDRE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provided: 2,938 lines of Python code which process a handful of large
files to create a number of outputs. [Details can't be disclosed.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objective: Refactor to distinguish between the overall sequence of
transformational steps and the details of each individual step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="observations"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Observations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is almost purely procedural. There are 11 class definitions.
6 of these wrap built-in types with type conversion and
null-handling. 1 is a new exception. 1 is a generic &amp;quot;table&amp;quot; that
essentially duplicates features of SQLite. The remaining 3 are
actually part of the problem domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason for reverse engineering is that the code has reached an
intellectual limit. It's small, but &amp;quot;dense&amp;quot; with highly-optimized
processing steps. The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science)#Types_of_cohesion"&gt;cohesion
type&lt;/a&gt;
is almost all &amp;quot;Temporal&amp;quot;. Processing is grouped into successive
processing loops; each loop contains a cluster of processing steps.
Consequently, it's quite hard to tease apart the algorithm to get a
&amp;quot;big picture&amp;quot; of what's going on. It's just a dense stand of trees.
No forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason for reverse engineering is to support the endless
adaptation and modification of the code base. The program is a kind
of &amp;quot;spreadsheet on steroids&amp;quot;. This isn't a simplistic collection of
cells and formulæ that permits simple what-if analysis. This is a
more complex set of formulæ that would be challenging (but not
impossible) to implement as a spreadsheet. The use case, however, is
the spreasheet use case: think, tweak, create results, repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tdre-approach"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TDRE Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with an &lt;strong&gt;Initial Survey&lt;/strong&gt; of the legacy code base and sample
files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create an Outline&lt;/strong&gt; or &amp;quot;sketch&amp;quot; of the domain model and main
program. This will be a modules (or a package) with comments and some
preliminary class definitions. Little more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick a processing Step&lt;/strong&gt; in the legacy code. This often requires
creating processing summaries of the legacy code. Most legacy code is
procedural, so the processing tends to be sequential in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instrument the Legacy Code&lt;/strong&gt; with print statements to gather data.
This can be simple. The output can be challenging to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
with open(&amp;quot;tdre_results_1&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;w&amp;quot;) as tdre:

# some legacy processing

print( &amp;quot;Case:&amp;quot;, foo, bar, &amp;quot;, Expect:&amp;quot;, baz, file=tdre )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the output, &lt;strong&gt;Build Unit Test Cases&lt;/strong&gt;. Fill in parts of the
processing sequence and domain model. Debug code until the tests
pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="initial-survey"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Initial Survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Initial Survey&lt;/strong&gt; locates several things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The usable, working modules. It appears that all reverse
engineering involves a code base with dead or unused code. Even a
small project (3,000 lines) will have a remarkable amount of dead
code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Priorities for the implemented functionality. Not every &amp;quot;main&amp;quot;
module is relevant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example inputs and outputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the software cannot be run (as is the case with organically
developed systems that depend on large, complex corporate
databases), then the example inputs and outputs may not actually
match the software. If the software can be run, it should be run
and the actuals compared against the samples to confirm that the
code base supplied really produced the sample outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect that the provided legacy code is slightly different from the
code in production use. In some cases, this cannot be resolved; for
example, when the executables are older than the source. In other
cases, the code matches and no further work is required to establish
the legacy baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sample outputs point in the direction of an acceptance test case.
The sample output cannot be taken literally as the one-and-only
acceptance test. While it's desirable for reverse engineering to
reproduce the sample output, most reverse engineering will involve
enhancements or bug fixes. Expect that errors will be found (or may
be known to exist) in the sample output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="create-outline"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create Outline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outline is -- initially -- just generic MVP. There must be a
domain model, some &amp;quot;presenter&amp;quot; that has the application logic, and
some &amp;quot;view&amp;quot; for displaying the outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case study, above, the &amp;quot;view&amp;quot; is a collection of (mostly text)
output files. The model was undefined in the legacy code, which was
all &amp;quot;presenter&amp;quot; application logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal was to extract the underlying model, break the application
&amp;quot;presenter&amp;quot; logic into two layers (forest and trees) and build some
views for each of the output files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pick-a-processing-step"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pick a Processing Step&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be challenging, depending on the legacy code base. There are
two paths through a procedural code base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back to Front. Start with the final results and unit test the
final steps based on previous steps that will be defined later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Front to Back. Start with the first recognizable intermediate
result based on the input files. Unit test the initial steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's more rewarding to work front-to-back because progress can be
shown a little more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better architecture can be created by working back-to-front since
dependencies are easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="unit-test-volume-edges-and-corners"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unit Test Volume, Edges and Corners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two unit test design challenges when doing reverse
engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume. The sample data can be large. 100,000 rows of sample data
is too many to test. Finding a &amp;quot;representative&amp;quot; subset is
difficult. Generally, arbitrary subsets have to be used to get
started. Once the application mostly works, more refined unit
tests need to be created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edge and Corner Cases. While the code may be riddled with
&lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt;-statements, it can still be difficult to locate sample
inputs that exercise the various conditions in the code. It's
risky to create data -- we have to assume that the legacy code
does unexpected things. In many cases, print statements have to be
put into complex if statements to locate any actual data that
exercises that logic path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the unit tests are built, this is just Test-Driven
Development (TDD).&lt;/p&gt;

discussions around performance
issues&lt;/a&gt;...&amp;quot; It's about
Stack Overflow, specifically. Apparently, someone didn't get their
question answered and decided it was better to gripe than to rewrite the
question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at their response in pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;people try to gang up&amp;quot;. Since there's almost no social networking
capability, this is a bit much to attribute to people responding to a
poorly-worded question. But, if you've worked all day on a bad
solution to a poorly-conceived problem, it can &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like being
ganged up on. When reality leaks in, it can feel unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hint 1. There are no gangs. It's possible that the question really is
poorly written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;cookie-cutter, patronizing, zero-information responses&amp;quot;. I'm
guessing these are comments suggesting the approach is bad and asking
for clarification. I run afoul of this often because I feel compelled
to post comments asking for clarification. Some folks just don't like
to clarify. More than once I've been told that their question was
very clear. Since I'm asking for clarification, it seems odd to
insist the question is perfect. Worse, of course, is asking for help
on Stack Overflow, but refusing to clarify the help required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hint 2. Clarify. Please. Don't insist that the question is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;they assume, without any basis, that the person has not (a)
benchmarked the code,&amp;quot; When the question has no bench mark data, this
isn't an assumption. It's a response to the lack of benchmark data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hint 3. Provide the facts. Don't complain when folks ask for facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;(b) is obviously running an inferior algorithm&amp;quot;. Again, this isn't
an assumption. It's the response to an incomplete question where the
algorithm isn't provided. Also, it's a common response to questions
where the algorithm really is inferior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hint 4. Consider that -- even after spending days banging your head
against the wall -- your question might be poorly-written and require
both benchmark data and an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;advice about premature optimization... is a well assimilated
folklore by now and I dont see how repeating that adds value&amp;quot;.
Without measurements, profiler results and benchmark data, this is
our only possible response. &lt;em&gt;After&lt;/em&gt; the profiler results are posted,
this advice really is useless. &lt;em&gt;Before&lt;/em&gt; profiler results are posted,
this advice often turns out to be essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hint 5. Whatever you might know is not well-assimilated folklore on
Stack Overflow as a whole. We don't know you, sadly. We don't know
how much you know. To avoid useless advice, provide evidence -- in
the question -- that the advice has &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; been followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;better served if the discussion shifted to ... Pointed out possible
bottlenecks ahead of time,&amp;quot; Wouldn't that be nice? What's a &amp;quot;possible
bottleneck&amp;quot;? It's a badly-design algorithm. So, the responses to
performance questions has to be focused on algorithm choice right
away. That means details on the code being used, and profiling
information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hint 6. There is no hint 6. This would simply repeat hints 3 and 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;regardless of the fact whether the code construct is actually a
bottleneck in the application or not, it is always good to know what
the more efficient alternatives are... there is something called
intellectual curiosity.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducing a question to a hand-waving hypothetical doesn't &lt;em&gt;improve&lt;/em&gt;
the question. It doesn't &lt;em&gt;rationalize&lt;/em&gt; a poor question. The question
still needs to be clarified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hint 7. If the question raises a lot of comments and useless advice,
please &lt;strong&gt;rewrite&lt;/strong&gt; the question.&lt;/p&gt;

I suggested that it's often pretty easy to get a spreadsheet of
full-worked out examples from subject-matter experts. Indeed, if your
following TDD, that spreadsheet of examples is solid gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's consider something relatively simple. Let's say we're working
on some fancy calculations. Our users explain until they're blue in
the face. We take careful notes. We &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; we understand. To
confirm, we ask for a simple spreadsheet with inputs and outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get something like the following. The latitudes and longitudes are
inputs. The ranges and bearings are outputs. [The math can be seen at
&amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html"&gt;Calculate distance, bearing and more between Latitude/Longitude
points&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="17%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="19%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="17%" /&gt;

&lt;col width="16%" /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead valign="bottom"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class="head"&gt;Latitude 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;Longitude 1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;Latitude 2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;Longitude 2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;range&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;bearing&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;50 21 50N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;004 09 25W&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;42 21 04N&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;071 02 27W&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2805 nm&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;260 07 38&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only it has a a few more rows with different examples. Equator
Crossing. Prime Meridian Crossing. All the usual suspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tdd-means-making-test-cases"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TDD Means Making Test Cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step one, then, is to parse the spreadsheet full of examples and
create some domain-specific examples. Since it's far, far easier to
work with .CSV files, we'll presume that we can save the
carefully-crafted spreadsheet as a simple .CSV with the columns shown
above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step two will be to create working Python code from the
domain-specific examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creation of test cases is a matter of building some intermediate
representation out of the spreadsheet. This is where plenty of
parsing and obscure special-case data handling may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
from __future__ import division
import csv
from collections import namedtuple
import re

latlon_pat= re.compile(&amp;quot;(\d+)\s+(\d+)\s+(\d+)([NSWE])&amp;quot;)
def latlon( txt ):
    match= latlon_pat.match( txt )
    d, m, s, h = match.groups()
    return float(d)+float(m)/60+float(s)/3600, h

angle_pat= re.compile(&amp;quot;(\d+)\s+(\d+)\s+(\d+)&amp;quot;)
def angle( txt ):
    match= angle_pat.match( txt )
    d, m, s = match.groups()
    return float(d)+float(m)/60+float(s)/3600

range_pat= re.compile(&amp;quot;(\d+)\s*(\D+)&amp;quot;)
def range( txt ):
    match= range_pat.match( txt )
    d, units = match.groups()
    return float(d), units

RangeBearing= namedtuple(&amp;quot;RangeBearing&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;lat1,lon1,lat2,lon2,rng,brg&amp;quot;)

def test_iter( filename=&amp;quot;sample_data.csv&amp;quot; ):
    with open(filename,&amp;quot;r&amp;quot;) as source:
        rdr= csv.DictReader( source )
        for row in rdr:
            print row
            tc= RangeBearing(
                latlon(row['Latitude 1']),  latlon(row['Longitude 1']),
                latlon(row['Latitude 2']),  latlon(row['Longitude 2']),
                range(row['range']),
                angle(row['bearing'])
                )
            yield tc

for tc in test_iter():
    print tc
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is long, but, it handles a lot of the formatting vagaries that
users are prone to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="from-abstract-to-testcase"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From Abstract to TestCase&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have a generator to build test cases as abstraction examples,
generating code for Java or Python or anything else is just a little
template-fu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
from string import Template
testcase= Template(&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
    class Test_${name}( unittest.TestCase ):
     def setUp( self ):
         self.p1= LatLon( lat=GlobeAngle(*$lat1), lon=GlobeAngle(*$lon1) )
         self.p2= LatLon( lat=GlobeAngle(*$lat2), lon=GlobeAngle(*$lon2) )
     def test_should_compute( self ):
         d, brg = range_bearing( p1, p2, R=$units )
         self.assertEquals( $dist, int(d) )
         self.assertEquals( $brg, map(int,map(round,brg.deg)))
    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;)
for name, tc in enumerate( test_iter() ):
    units= tc.rng[1].upper()
    dist= tc.rng[0]
    code= testcase.substitute( name=name, dist=dist, units=units, **tc._asdict()  )
    print code
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows a simple template with values filled in. Often, we have to
generate a hair more than this. A few imports, a &amp;quot;unittest.main()&amp;quot; is
usually sufficient to transform a spreadsheet into unit tests that we
can confidently use for test-driven development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the question focused on the difficulty of preparing test
cases that cover the requirements. In particular, there was some
hand-wringing over conflicting and contradictory requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what's worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation&lt;/strong&gt;. The users provide the test cases as a spreadsheet
showing the business rules. The columns are attributes of some
business document or case. The rows are specific test cases. Users
can (and often will) do this at the drop of a hat. Often complex,
narrative requirements written by business analysts are based on such
a spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is remarkably easy for must users to produce. It's just a
spreadsheet (or multiple spreadsheets) with concrete examples. It's
often easier for users to make concrete examples than it is for them
to write more general business rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="automated-test-case-construction"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Automated Test Case Construction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what can easily happen next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a Python script to parse the spreadsheet and extract the cases.
There will be some ad-hoc rules, inconsistent test cases, small
technical problems. The spreadsheets will be formatted poorly or
inconsistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the cases are parsed, it's easy to then create a
Unittest.TestCase template of some kind. Use
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/"&gt;Jinja2&lt;/a&gt; or even Python's string.Template
class to rough out the template for the test case. The specifics get
filled into the unit test template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outline of test case construction is something like this. Details
vary with target language, test case design, and overall test case
packaging approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
t = SomeTemplate()
for case_dict in testCaseParser( &amp;quot;some.xls&amp;quot; ):
    code= t.render( **case_dict )
    with open(testcaseName(**case_dict ),'w') as result:
        result.write( code )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now have a fully-populated tree of unit test classes, modules and
packages built from the end-user source documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have your tests. You can start doing TDD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="scenarios"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scenarios&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the earliest problems you'll have is test case spreadsheets
that are broken. Wrong column titles, wrong formatting, something
wrong. Go meet with the user or expert that built the spreadsheet and
get the thing straightened out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there's some business subtlety to this. Or perhaps they're
just careless. What's important is that the spreadsheets have to be
parsed by simple scripts to create simple unit tests. If you can't
arrive at a workable solution, you have Big Issues and it's better to
resolve it now than try to press on to implementation with a user or
SME that's uncooperative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem you'll have is that tests will be inconsistent. This
will be confusing at first because you've got code that passed one
test, and fails another test and you can't tell what the differences
between the tests are. You have to go meet with the users or SME's
and resolve what the issue is. Why are the tests inconsistent? Often,
attributes are missing from the spreadsheet -- attributes they each
assumed -- and attributes you didn't have explicitly written down
anywhere. Other times there's confusion that needs to be resolved
before any programming should begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-big-payoff"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Big Payoff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the tests all pass, you're ready for performance and final
acceptance testing. Here's where TDD (and having the users own the
test cases) pays out well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say we're running the final acceptance test cases and the users
balk at some result. &amp;quot;Can't be right&amp;quot; they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, almost nothing. Get the correct answer into a spreadsheet
somewhere. The test cases were incomplete. This always happens.
Outside TDD, it's called &amp;quot;requirements problem&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;scope creep&amp;quot; or
something else. Inside TDD, it's called &amp;quot;test coverage&amp;quot; and some more
test cases are required. Either way, test cases are always
incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be that they're actually changing an earlier test case. Users
get examples wrong, too. Either way (omission or error) we're just
fixing the spreadsheets, regenerating the test cases, and starting up
the TDD process with the revised suite of test cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bug-fixing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bug Fixing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, a bug fix after production roll-out is no different
from an acceptance test problem. Indeed it's no different from
anything that's happened so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user spots a bug. They report it. We ask for the concrete example
that exemplifies the correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We regenerate the test cases from the spreadsheets and start doing
development. 80% of the time, the new example is actually a change to
an existing example. And since the users built the example
spreadsheets with the test data, they can maintain those spreadsheets
to clarify the bugs. 20% of the time it's a new requirement. Either
way, the test cases are as complete and consistent as the users are
capable of producing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire application system has pretty good test coverage. I use
the Python
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html"&gt;unittest&lt;/a&gt; to do
integration testing. A test module spins up a Django test server;
each TestCase uses the RESTful API library access the web servers
through a variety of use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However. This integration isn't done through Apache and mod_wsgi.
It's done using Django's stand-alone testserver capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I noted recently, Apache doesn't like to give up the HTTP
Authorization header. So, the real deployment on our real servers
didn't really work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-blame-game"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Blame Game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point there are lots of things we can blame. Let's start
blaming the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TDD didn't help. By now it should be obvious that TDD is a
complete waste of time because it didn't uncover this obvious
integration issue. There's no justification for TDD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#.  The Unit Testing framework didn't help. It's a completely blown
u   nit. Unit testing is oversold as a technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliance on &amp;quot;testing&amp;quot; is stupid. There's no point in even
attempting to &amp;quot;test&amp;quot; software, since it still broke when we tried
to deploy it. Testing simply doesn't uncover enough problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, we need a Bold New Process to solve and prevent problems
like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="seriously"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seriously&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search Stack Overflow for &amp;quot;Justification of TDD&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ROI of Unit
Testing&amp;quot; and those kinds of loaded questions and you'll find folks
that are angry that software development is hard and TDD or Unit
Testing or a slick IDE or a Dynamic Language or REST or SOAP or
something didn't make software easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no Pixie Dust. You've been told. Stop searching for it.
Software is hard. Unit Testing helps, but doesn't make it less
hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="unit-testing-to-the-rescue"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unit Testing to the Rescue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our code coverage is -- at best -- middlin'. I don't have counts,
nor do I actually care what the lines of code number is. Code
coverage can devolve to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2010_02_23-numerosity_more_metrics_without_meaning.html"&gt;numerosity&lt;/a&gt;.
The method function coverage and use case coverage is more
interesting. A &amp;quot;logic path coverage&amp;quot; might be helpful. But I'm
sure our coverage is far from complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there we were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hundreds of unit tests pass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A suite of a half-dozen &amp;quot;integration&amp;quot; scripts (over a dozen
TestCases) pass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real Apache deployment fails because I couldn't figure out how
to get mod_wsgi to pass the HTTP Authorization header. Even
though it's clearly and simply documented. [I was busy focusing
on Apache; mod_wsgi solves the problem handily.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did was copy a page from AWS and put the digested
authentication information in a query string. In one sense,
this is a huge change to the API's -- it's visible. In another
sense this is a minor tweak to the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RESTful web services all rely on an authenticator object.
The change amounted to a new subclass of this authenticator.
Plus some refactoring to locate the digest in the query string.
This is a tightly focused change in authentication and the
client library. About two days of work to subclass and refactor
the auth.rest module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="success-factors"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Success Factors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of TDD and a suite of unit tests, many things went
really, really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could extend the test script for the auth.rest module to
include the new authentication-via-query-string mechanism.
Having tests that failed made is really easy to refactor and
subclass until the tests passed. Then I could refactor some
more to simplify the resulting modules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could rerun the unittest suite, including the various
&amp;quot;integration&amp;quot; tests (tests that had everything by Apache) to
be sure everything still worked. Believe it or not, there
were actual problems uncovered by this. Specifically, some
tests didn't properly use the web services API library. The
library had changed, but was &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; backwards compatible,
so the tests had continued to work. The latest round of
changes broke backwards compatibility, and some tests now
failed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despair did not set in. There were issues: sales folks were
in total panic because the whole &amp;quot;house of cards&amp;quot;
architecture had collapsed. A working test suite makes a
compelling case that the application -- generally -- is
still sound. We're just stumbling on an Apache deployment
issue. In one sense, it's a &amp;quot;show stopper&amp;quot;, but in another
sense it's just a Visible But Minor (VBM™) hurdle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don't like (or want) unit testing, you set the threshold really high.  100% code coverage, or worse, 100% logic path coverage.  Since these goals are difficult to achieve, the whole unit testing business can be made to go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're struggling with quality issues, and you just want things fixed, you can also demand some kind of 100% coverage number as a &amp;quot;stretch goal&amp;quot;.  This may not be a bad thing.  Unless, of course, you have no unit testing at all, then it's intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pragmatic-testing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pragmatic Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pragmatically, you really want to test the logic paths you'll encounter during &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; operations.  That is the 97% coverage of non-exception, non-crazy, non-edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's subjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it can't be actually measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about the metric issue.  If I do 100% logic path coverage -- every single path -- every exception -- everything -- I'm pretty sure my software will be rock solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I miss say 3% of the edge cases, what does that mean?  Will my software &amp;quot;not work&amp;quot;?  Will it be &amp;quot;unacceptably buggy?&amp;quot;  Unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 100% coverage doesn't correlate with anything else I can measure.  50% test coverage doesn't mean the system is half buggy, or runs half the time, or looses half the transactions, or processes each transaction only half-way through.  No, 50% test coverage means half the system is rock solid and the other half is probably really good, also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="gut-check"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gut Check&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some &amp;quot;is there enough testing?&amp;quot; gut check questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would you refactor it?  This is the most basic level of test coverage -- enough to refactor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would you immediately blame installation, operations, maintenance, support -- anyone else -- or would you dig in to find the problem?  This is a higher-level of coverage.  Enough that you're sure it's an installation issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the customer was a psycho and took you to court, and you had to provide testimony, do you have any hard evidence that things essentially work?  Not absolute 100% proof, but some evidence to back up your claim that you think it works and the customer's a whacko.  This is still a higher-level because you have to explain it to civilians and lawyers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would you use it as an example a training class on testing?  This is the highest level -- knowledgeable peers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both questions are quite amazing because they already have a modular, flexible rules engine (called &amp;quot;python&amp;quot;) but it's not good enough: they want to use Python to build something that's -- well -- more Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's weirder than &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/"&gt;PyPy&lt;/a&gt; , which makes a certain amount of meta-level sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="business-rules"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Business Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules engine question provides a tidy specification for three central features of Python: Regular expression matching, arithmetic comparisons, and Boolean operators.  Then they go on to provide a sample expression that's almost (but not quite) python code.  I'm not sure their tiny syntax change is worth the effort of writing a parser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our application, we have a large number of fairly complex business rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, we don't have a tidy specification of what those rules &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt;  are.  Instead, we have some kinds of flow charts, and some cultural norms, and folks who know a lot about the problem domain.  We could have spent nine months digging.  Instead, I elected to spend nine months programming in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When things change, the code is easy to change.  Good OO design principles allow us to capitalize in simple &lt;strong&gt;Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;  pattern and &lt;strong&gt;Command&lt;/strong&gt;  pattern to &amp;quot;plug in&amp;quot; different modules.  In some cases, we've found that we didn't foresee the need for a Strategy plug in and are forced to refactor some packages to reflect what we learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is our business rules engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="modularity"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Modularity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a nebulous offering.  Our business model is simple, and based around some smart people who offer a very clever consulting service.  The software packages some of the consulting results in a form that a customer can subscribe to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, each customer could be unique.  And our service offering &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;  expand as we get better and better at this.  So we'll have lots of plug-and-play modules for customer-specific features and expansions of the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what Python does best.  I've already done significant on-the-fly refactoring as we find new opportunities.  Why use Python to build a super-meta &amp;quot;modular&amp;quot; database?  Python already is modular, and so is SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="django-s-world-view"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Django's World View&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best parts of using Django is the &amp;quot;build-the-model-first&amp;quot; world view.  Confronted with requirements, my approach is this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a model that works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write unit tests to show how the use cases are implemented with this model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the admin folderol to build a reasonable admin interface for this model.  This actually takes quite a bit of effort to decide what lists and filters to use and where to put the inline forms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write RESTful URI's and view functions for our Web Services and our HTML views.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Piss around with templates until we're tired of responding to random tester/user/owner feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible, Modular, Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, actually, it wasn't their first.  It was their third.  But their first two were haphazard &amp;quot;we hope this works&amp;quot; kind of web sites.  They relied on third-party security and were pretty sure they were using it correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was involved with their first externally-facing application.   We were going through a &amp;quot;risk-exposure&amp;quot; analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of their people was so uncomfortable that they balked at the very idea of a fixed list of risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We don't know what we don't know,&amp;quot; they pronounced.  Their claim was that security considerations included an unbounded list of vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="vulnerability-lists"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vulnerability Lists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make regular use of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.owasp.org/"&gt;OWASP&lt;/a&gt;  top 10 vulnerabilities and other resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I learned about the SANS Institute's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sans.org/top25errors/"&gt;top 25 coding errors&lt;/a&gt; .  They provide three categories of errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sans.org/top25errors/#cat1"&gt;Category: Insecure Interaction Between Components (9 errors)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sans.org/top25errors/#cat2"&gt;Category: Risky Resource Management (9 errors)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sans.org/top25errors/#cat3"&gt;Category: Porous Defenses (7 errors)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, there's the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_howard/archive/2005/07/11/437875.aspx"&gt;19 Deadly Sins of Software Security&lt;/a&gt;  list.  [Thanks!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very, very handy stuff.  There's nothing better than a concrete checklist of errors to structure architecture, design, and coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-we-don-t-know"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What We Don't Know&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are unknown, unlisted, yet-unexploited vulnerabilities.  Until those are discovered, we really &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt;  know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't waste a lot of time on a complex risk/cost analysis.  These are complex -- often subjective -- and very expensive.  A short list of exposure and cost is all you need.  And often, the short list includes something like &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.noao.edu/cas/hr/faq/faq_hipaa.html#six"&gt;HIPAA PHI&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot; and that's all you need to know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a straight-forward checklist of vulnerabilities built from these lists.  Numerous items appear on all three lists, that's the bare minimum of security considerations.  The union of all three lists isn't that big or complex.  Your framework or language may not even have some of these vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's probably cheaper to just plug these known holes than it is to decide which -- if any -- holes have &amp;quot;enough&amp;quot; expected value of a loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's my strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A furnace transfer switch.  See this &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en-us&amp;amp;q=Furnace+Transfer+Switch"&gt;http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en-us&amp;amp;q=Furnace+Transfer+Switch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A small (1.7Kw) generator.  See this &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=1700+w+generator"&gt;http://www.google.com/search?q=1700+w+generator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An extension cord that goes well out into the backyard.  Folks died around here from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide_poisoning"&gt;CO poisoning&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes some discipline, but I think one can manage with a tiny, thrifty generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put the food in a cooler and move it from fridge to porch when the porch is colder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the furnace as necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unplug the furnace, plug in the sump pump as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all good software, I think it's just enough.  The fully automated transfer switches and full-powered generators seem more complex than necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lighting?  I have flashlights and lanterns, and a Weems and Plath Oil Yacht Lamp.  Internet?  Panera, Starbucks, and others offer WiFi.  What else is there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's some of the argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's some of the argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editing&lt;/strong&gt;.  Which is easier?  Which is more expressive?  Some say that Text (INI format especially) is easier -- but I don't see what.  Python is just as easy as INI, and has more expressive power.  Advantage Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reloading&lt;/strong&gt;.  It is easier to reload configuration options from a regular text file than a Python import.  I'm not sure what we're reloading or why, but I do depend on Apache reloading it's configuration.  However, I've never written a program that reloaded anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configuration Control&lt;/strong&gt;.  This statement makes approximately no sense: &amp;quot;Code files should be read only&amp;quot;  What distinguishes code in .INI format from code in .PY format?  Both are code; one is relatively stable &amp;quot;source&amp;quot; and the other is relatively &amp;quot;dymamic&amp;quot; configuration.  But they're both code, subject to slightly different rules of use.  This usage difference doesn't have anything to do with syntax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debugging&lt;/strong&gt;.  Somehow, .INI errors are purported to be easier to debug.  I don't get this.  I suppose it's true if you don't use &lt;strong&gt;try&lt;/strong&gt;  blocks.  If, on the other hand, you use ordinary &lt;strong&gt;try&lt;/strong&gt;  blocks, you can produce easy-to-live-with error messages from importing a Python config module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Security&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;.  I put &amp;quot;security&amp;quot; in quotes because it's not at all clear what we're securing against.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Python has better syntax, and non-Python is slightly easier to reload.  At this point, we've got no good reason for anything other than Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-security-specter"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Security Specter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not clear why &amp;quot;security&amp;quot; keeps surfacing.  I can't determine the threat scenario.  Since the config files are under tight permission control, only a sys admin can change them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the security threat is a sys admin who knows Python and is using the configuration files to subvert something in the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And -- bonus -- there can be no other corporate controls over the system being subverted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait -- what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No controls.  The security thing only makes sense when you have programming sysadmins and no controls.  Python syntax vs. .INI syntax has nothing to do with this.&lt;/p&gt;

While -- technically -- it does have a question, it's more of a rant against formal unit testing than a proper question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the conflation comment.  &amp;quot;I've worked with developers who never caught any errors in their unit tests.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, a test which passes initially has no value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that they're complaining that it has no &lt;em&gt;debugging&lt;/em&gt;  value.  If it passes, it absolutely has testing value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="debugging-and-testing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debugging and Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A test which fails give us a chance to debug.  It tells us something is broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A test which passes could mean anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could means that we wrote the code correctly first, then wrote some tests, and the tests passed because -- well -- we're really good at coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could also mean that our tests weren't complete enough to find a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, when a test passes, we don't get a chance to debug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And -- it appears from the conversation on StackOverflow -- no debugging is a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="good-test-bad-test"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good Test, Bad Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that tests have only two outcomes: pass and fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tests aren't benchmarks.  If you want to know how many concurrent transactions before the app fails or becomes too slow to use, that's a benchmark.  Not a test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, on the other hand, you have to handle 40,000 transactions per hour, you have something testable; a test boils down to pass or fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've worked with consultants who claim that benchmarking is part of testing.  I agree that benchmarking might be part of a test &lt;em&gt;phase&lt;/em&gt;  or test &lt;em&gt;activity&lt;/em&gt;.  Unless it can fail (and you know the threshold that counts as failure) it isn't a test.  Running it until it breaks isn't &amp;quot;testing&amp;quot;.  It's exploring or analyzing or learning or something.  But until there's a way to fail, it isn't testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="testing-and-debugging"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing and Debugging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I've learned recently is that debugging can be done using testing tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say you have an integration test that fails.  The logs and results aren't clear enough to pinpoint a problem.  And -- worse -- no unit test reflects this problem.  That's evidence that you're missing some unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than add logging statements or learn to use the debugger, here's what works well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hypothesize some error that would pass unit tests and fail integration tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a new test to plug that gap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycle around those two steps for a while and you both find the problem and build up the test portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some additional material was posted in an answer (not in the question, where it belongs) making it a little hard to go from question to answers.  The original poster's non-answer had a great little block of code that's potentially funny.  [This is the real example; I tidied it up a little.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
class Generic:
    ''' Generic class all other classes inherit '''
    def kill(self):
        del self
        #Need a way to remove the instance of the class

class Item(Generic):
    def __init__(self,name):
        self.name = name

class Being(Generic):
    def __init__(self,name):
        self.name = name
        self.bag = []
    def pick_up(self,target):
        self.bag.append(target)
        target.kill()

player = Being('Hero')
cat = Item('Cat')

print'Players inventory',player.bag

print'Picking up the cat'
player.pick_up(cat)

print'Players inventory',player.bag
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-cat-is-out-of-the-bag"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Cat is Out of the Bag&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really.  The example was about letting the cat out of the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/293431/python-object-deleting-itself#293920"&gt;My answer&lt;/a&gt;  included the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under no circumstances does any Python object ever need to get deleted. If an item is &amp;quot;destroyed&amp;quot;, then it's not in a Being's bag. It's not in a location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
player.bag.remove(cat)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is all that's required to let the cat out of the bag. Since the cat is not used anywhere else, it will both exist as &amp;quot;used&amp;quot; memory and not exist because nothing in your program can access it. It will quietly vanish from memory when some quantum event occurs and memory references are garbage collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I think there is a parallel between Schrodinger's cat and garbage collection.  The cat exists while you're using it.  After you cease to reference it, it may -- or may not -- exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, maybe it wasn't that funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[BTW, when the business owners and executives ask the Python question, I say &amp;quot;speed&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;flexibility&amp;quot;.  Rather than spend 6 weeks with the SME's trying to get all the use cases written, I start from anything that might be a use case and start writing.  Once we have something we can touch and feel, lessons are learned, scope is creeped.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the business model has all the value, why protect the software?  They can reverse engineer the code, but they can't reverse engineer our ability to create new, clever business models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-do-we-do"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What do we do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/261638/how-do-i-protect-python-code#261727"&gt;Stackoverflow answer&lt;/a&gt;  has the salient points.  In short, contracts still work, offering significant value rules.   [And it's my first &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/badges/24/good-answer"&gt;Good Answer&lt;/a&gt;  badge.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one we're using, however, is still very appealing.  Software as a service:  the SaaS model allows us to offer the services, enhance them and even customize them, without disclosing everything to our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're a services firm, we're interested in the business consulting.  We're capable of managing and executing the planned rewrite of our customer's legacy software to make use of our services.  Rather than mess around with lawyers, we figure it's better to create software so valuable that our customers would rather not waste time and money on reverse engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know they'll invent new scenarios.  We know they'll want to save that configuration.  With Django's admin utilities, we can do a &amp;quot;dumpdata&amp;quot; that preserves the interesting parts of the the database.  That much is easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do a trivial kind of database reset for the sales folks.  Django gives us the SQL reset script, and the &amp;quot;loaddata&amp;quot; utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two problems, however.  First, this is command-line stuff, and we know that the sales folks can't be trusted with anything that isn't a double-clickable icon.  Second, we have to keep some pristine copies in a place where they can't get accidentally overwritten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second problem is easy to solve.  We can put some JSON fixtures in the SVN repository.  They're easy to refresh in case of damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem, however, is tougher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="to-gui-to-not-to-gui"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To GUI to Not to GUI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple shell script of the form DUMP_TO somename is not going to get used.  It requires too much work to manage the names because it's not visual.  It isn't a GUI &amp;quot;Save As...&amp;quot; dialog box that shows existing files.  And it's command-line stuff, which the sales folks object to as being too low-tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, a big-old desktop GUI is just what the doctor ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what about restores?  If we write a fat-client GUI, we can easily have two operating modes: backup to a .JSON and restore from a .JSON.  The cool thing is that we can show two lists of .JSON files -- the local ones, plus the golden copies tucked away in the SVN checkout directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="simplify"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Simplify&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's my thought for simplification: skip the restore GUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sales folks want a double-clickable icon for restore.  We can easily do that by writing two things when we do the Django &amp;quot;dumpdata&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The .JSON fixture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A .BAT file that does the restore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of .BAT files becomes a simple menu of double-clickable icons that will restore the database to a known condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

It offers web services and it consumes web services.  It does some complex calculations of it's own and it's got a pretty complex database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I like to have is a &amp;quot;ready for deployment&amp;quot; test suite that exercises pretty much everything.  This is several layers of testing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Django Unit Tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python Unit Tests (for non-Django components)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration Tests (built on unittest.TestCase, but somewhat more complex)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes several minutes to run through the test sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rest-integration-tests"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;REST Integration Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of our tests are pretty big REST tests.  We launch the Django &amp;quot;testserver&amp;quot; version of the server (with a known set of fixtures) and use a REST client to execute sequences of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we would get a urllib2 IOError which contained a socket.error (10054 on Windows, 104 in Linux).  Sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text was &amp;quot;Connection Reset by Peer&amp;quot;.  First, it was intermittent.  Second, we had bigger fish to fry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, it became the long pole in the tent, and I dug into it.  Part of the reason is the count-down to deployment, and the resulting turnover to sysadmins.  But another part of the reason was that we have very stable software (finally) and we're starting to expand the unit tests to cover more obscure edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="consistently-intermittent"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consistently Intermittent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most maddening thing about Connection Reset by Peer is the pattern of getting it.  And not getting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, it appeared randomly.  Then we stopped getting it in development.  Problem fixed, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On VMWare, however, it was -- mostly -- reproducible.  On Windows, it never happened.  And yes, they're both Python 2.5.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="which-side"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Which Side?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're debugging REST transactions.  Since we see it solidly under VMWare, let's dig in.  Which side?  From the logs, it  becomes clear that it's on the client side.  The Django server looks to be rock-solid.  When Django's WSGI server logs the status code and size of the response, this is followed immediately by flush and close.  No opportunity for something bad to happen to the socket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we're focused at our client, based on urllib2.  Sometimes we get it the error, sometimes we don't.  When we get it, however, it's in exactly the same point in the test sequence.   And under VMWare, we're getting it consistently enough that we can work with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, as we move code around, the &amp;quot;Connection Reset By Peer&amp;quot; moves around.  When it occurs, it occurs in a consistent location in the test sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've upgraded our client to retry the transaction.  Generally, a half-dozen retries (or fewer) and the transaction completes normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-global-interpreter-lock"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Global Interpreter Lock&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I'm convinced I've found something in Python itself.  Since we're running client, server, and MySQL database all under VMWare, I think we're looking at some small bug within urllib2.  I think it's threading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read up on the GIL.  The article by Aahz in PyZine, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pyzine.com/Issue001/Section_Articles/article_ThreadingGlobalInterpreter.html"&gt;Threading the Global Interpreter Lock&lt;/a&gt;  has some notes on the way that time.sleep() changes thread scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I changed the positions of time.sleep() calls in our client library or unittest sequence, the &amp;quot;Connection Reset by Peer&amp;quot; error moved, also.  It looks like we're suffering from some kind of interlock that's interfering with the client side of the socket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GIL is switched every 100 Python byte-code instructions.  That leads to very consistent behavior.  That's why it can be the same test in the test sequence or not at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="does-it-matter"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Does It Matter?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I think it doesn't matter.  The all-on-one box testing is contrived.  With the retry loop, we can get to 100% success, it just takes a passel of retries.  For now, the log of connection reset retries is a side-light.  As we move toward scalability testing across multiple, independent boxes, we'll see if the problem persists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that it's a totally back-office kind of relationship.  Worse, we don't have solid use cases.  We have working software for some use cases, but every conference call with the sales team leads to -- well -- confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use Case 1.  Customer sales person sits down at their workstation, decides to sell some product, and in the process of the sales call, gets information from us that adjusts the pricing, terms or conditions of the sales process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use Case 2.  Customer marketing person sits down at their workstation, decides to market some product.  In the process of developing the campaign, gets information from us that adjusts pricing, terms or conditions.  What does the marketing person see?  A long delay while their campaign goes to us and comes back with prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="demo-problems"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Demo Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't demo the sales process very well because they don't see much.  Just a &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; price or terms or something.  But there's no before/after kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, our mock-up of a sales person's application software won't match anything any of our customers have, we'll spend the whole sales call arguing about the data elements, the format, the color of the background and the labels on the buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't demo the marketing process very well because (a) it's overnight and (b) it's still invisible.  If we do it in seconds, it sets a false expectation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pilot-instead-of-demo"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pilot Instead of Demo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we have to do is to get the sales folks away from demo and into pilot.  And the best way to do this is to refine our extensibility features so that we can spin up a new pilot really quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're using Python, so parsing spreadsheets, loading database, and customizing a Django configuration shouldn't take too long.  I'm hoping that we can get a pilot ready in about as much time as it takes to schedule a &amp;quot;Big Demo&amp;quot; with the decision-makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, a pilot will show real results for a subset of situations.  It won't show a glossy walk-through of some use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that our sales folks are used to Java-scale development where every change takes a month.  At this point, the only thing that will win their hearts and minds is to really deliver on the first few pilots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

That was a &amp;quot;aha!&amp;quot; moment.  The problem is that I've been looking at incomplete, poorly-structured examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem I have with CSS and XPath is the multiple dimensions of search.  You can be talking about an element, an ID or a CLASS or some combination.   For me, the distinctions aren't obvious enough.  Making therm obvious, however, makes CSS (or XPath) so wordy as to be unusable.  So, I have to get over that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem that I have with CSS is that the display model for browser pages is really complicated.  The basic HTML markup is delightfully simple, but it has the consequence of making complex structures when rendered on a page.  Worse, of course, is the fact that I started with SGML and also use DocBook XML, which are principally semantic markup with very little display capabilities.  HTML has this mixture of semantic and non-semantic markup.  I try to use semantic markup as much as possible, but it's hard to debug my CSS rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to teach an HTML/XML class, which will include CSS.  I'd like to include a tool like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://macrabbit.com/cssedit/"&gt;CSSEdit&lt;/a&gt; , but that's Mac-only, and our customer base (with one exception) is firmly anti-Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will, however, direct them &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/"&gt;/* Position Is Everything */&lt;/a&gt; , which was a wonderful resource to discover. Some of the IE stuff has an update date of December 9, 2006, but I don't think any of the bugs have been fixed.  Indeed, the newest IE's preserve the old bugs for &amp;quot;compatibility&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[A bug is an undocumented feature; by preserving the old bugs, they become features.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the style editing in Eclipse will help.  Also, I've found &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/"&gt;Amaya&lt;/a&gt; , which might help teach people (like me) how to control the features of CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step one is to look inside the zip archives and see what we have.  Clearly, we can do this any of several ways.  Looking manually doesn't get us any software, so we may as well write  a Python program to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a pattern that develops to this kind of exploration.  It uses basic inheritance to extend and extend and extend simple file processing.  Further, it uses inheritance to extend instead of rewrite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the first class definition.  It isn't very interesting, but it shows the design pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
class Operation( object ):
    def process( self, files ):
        for fileName in files:
            self.processFile( fileName )
    def processFile( self, fileName ):
        pass
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the process method is the &amp;quot;entry point&amp;quot; and it applies some yet-to-be defined process to each file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a subclass that provides that process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
class ZipContent( Operation ):
    def processFile( self, fileName ):
        zip= zipfile.ZipFile( fileName )
        for member in zip.infolist():
            print &amp;quot;%s: %s %s&amp;quot; % ( fileName, member.filename, locale.format(&amp;quot;%d&amp;quot;,member.file_size,grouping=True) )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This implements processFile with a simple exploration of the zip files we were sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're essentially done with sprint 1.  We can use this to explore our files.  Turns out that each zip file contains a single XLS document.  Consistency is pleasant.  On to Sprint 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="exploring-the-zip-members"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exploring The Zip Members&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's sprint two of the application.  There are two significant changes.  First, we make a small incremental change to the previous ZipContent class.  Then we add a subclass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the revised processFile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
def processFile( self, fileName ):
        zip= zipfile.ZipFile( fileName )
        for member in zip.infolist():
            print &amp;quot;%s: %s %s&amp;quot; % ( fileName, member.filename, locale.format(&amp;quot;%d&amp;quot;,member.file_size,grouping=True) )
            self.examineMember( zip, member )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change is to add a &amp;quot;next level of detail&amp;quot; processing step: examineMember.  We merely provide a stub definition that does nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the next subclass.  It opens each zip archive member as a workbook, using the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.lexicon.net/sjmachin/xlrd.htm"&gt;xlrd&lt;/a&gt;  module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
class WBZipContent( ZipContent ):
    def examineMember( self, zipFile, member ):
        contents= zipFile.read( member.filename )
        wb= xlrd.open_workbook( file_contents=contents, filename=member.filename )
        for sheet in wb.sheets():
            self.examineSheet( wb, sheet )
    def examineSheet( self, wb, sheet ):
        print &amp;quot;&amp;gt;  Sheet %s %d rows&amp;quot; % (sheet.name, sheet.nrows )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows the &amp;quot;next level of detail&amp;quot; method.  Once we've opened the workbook, we can then hand each sheet to another method.  Initially, that other method just prints the sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven't replaced any previous piece of code.  We've added some procedure calls to previous version, but we focused on extension, not revision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're done with sprint 2.  We can use this to explore our files.  We find that each zip archive has an XLS file.  We find that each XLS file has a consistently-named set of sheets -- just what we think we should have received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we can subclass this -- yet again -- to build the next sprint and dump selected rows from each book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="exploring-the-workbook-sheets"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exploring the Workbook sheets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's sprint three of the application.  This is yet another subclass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
class TopRowsWBZipContent( WBZipContent ):
    def __init__( self, topnRows=5 ):
        super( TopRowsWBZipContent, self ).__init__()
        self.topnRows= topnRows
    def examineSheet( self, wb, sheet ):
        print &amp;quot;&amp;gt;  Sheet %s %d rows&amp;quot; % (sheet.name, sheet.nrows )
        if self.topnRows is None:
            limit= sheet.nrows
        else:
            limit= min( self.topnRows, sheet.nrows )
        for r in xrange(limit):
            row= sheet.row(r)
            print r, [ c.value for c in row ]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use the sprint 3 version to confirm that each sheet of each book of each ZIP archive has the expected format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we're ready to subclass this yet again and actually extract the relevant rows and columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="incremental-extension"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Incremental Extension&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incremental extension is a big time-saver.  Rather than have several programs, or several complex options, our main program now does several things.  Which specific thing is does is simply a choice of which class it instantiates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a version of main.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
def manual():
    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Change the options manually.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
    #op= ZipContent() # What's in the ZIP files?
    #op= TopRowsWBZipContent( topnRows=5 ) # What does the data look like?
    op= ExtractCSVWBZipContent(&amp;quot;../data&amp;quot;)
    files = glob.glob( &amp;quot;../data/*.zip&amp;quot; )
    op.processList( files )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we instantiate ZipContent, we get the sprint 1 version -- the one that explores the zip archives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we instantiate TopRowsWBZipContent, we get the the sprint 2 version that shows the top few rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incremental feature set is very handy and stems directly from two things: incremental development and two extending the inheritance hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Maybe a the title should be &amp;quot;Seduced by Technology&amp;quot;, rather than &amp;quot;The Business Analyst Lied.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, it sounded like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Our customer asks for a recommendation regarding an offering.  Based on the description of the offering, we use web services to get some scoring information from our vendors.  We combine that with our own proprietary models.  We reply with the recommendation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a UML collaboration diagram that shows the vendor scoring web service requests front and center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got it.  Ready to code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="not-so-fast"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not So Fast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, that this &amp;quot;get the vendor data&amp;quot; isn't actually what's going on.  It turns out that there are four parts to the recommendation.  Two of those parts involve vendor data and two of our proprietary models.  The other two parts involve two more proprietary models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web services turned everyone's heads.  It was &amp;quot;novel&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;confusing&amp;quot; so it got a lot of press.  The actual proprietary models were -- umm -- business as usual and hardly worth a page of documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;. The business value is in the model.  But no one saw fit to document this.  And I'm not smart enough to ask.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay.  So, the process is really this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Our customer asks for a recommendation regarding an offering.  Based on the description of the offering, we evaluate our four-part proprietary model.  Two parts of the model happen to require some scoring information from our vendors; we use web services to get this.  We reply with the recommendation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revised requirements:  our model is front and center.  The vendor information and associated web service requests support part of our model.  Got it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="still-not-right"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Still Not Right&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After building a bunch of stuff, it turns out that I was still being lied to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;  happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 1.  &amp;quot;The sales folks get our customer's entire catalog of offerings.  Our Deep Thinkers then get scoring information from our vendors on all of the offerings, and develop a four-part model.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 2.  &amp;quot;Our customer can ask for a recommendation regarding an offering.  Based on the description of the offering, we evaluate our four-part proprietary model.  Two parts of the model happen to require some scoring information from our vendors.  &lt;em&gt;Information we already have&lt;/em&gt;.  We reply with the recommendation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, first they give us all the possible offerings.  Then we get &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt;  the vendor information.  Then we build our proprietary four-part model using the vendor information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ummm... Where are the web services?  Where's the &amp;quot;on-the-fly&amp;quot; query to the vendor to get scoring information?  It turns out that we already have all of the necessary vendor information.  We had to have the all the vendor information in the first place so that could build the model!  Why would we go back to the vendor on a recommendation-by-recommendation basis when we already have all the data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;.  A big performance improvement will result from this realization.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="chickens-and-eggs"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chickens and Eggs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first draft made it look like there was no model -- only vendor data acquired through Web Services.  At the last instant.  All dynamic and state of the art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it sounded like the model was central, supported by some vendor data acquired through Web Services.  Still pretty dynamic and state of the art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But where did the model come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh That.  The model was built from giant sets of data.  It involved simple batch transfers from customer to us, us to our vendors, and our vendors back to us.  We load the database with customer data, vendor data and our model.  Not dynamic.  No web services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business value is in our proprietary model, and the folks that have experience, insight and skills to build that.  It's not in the fancy Web Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not that we get a query and do calculations on the fly.  We already know what we'll be asked.  We've already thought this through.  There's almost no 'on-the-fly' to this business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-to-the-rescue"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Python to the Rescue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's why I love Python.  I learned all this while building a working application in Django.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My summary of the Django world view is &amp;quot;Model first; default admin; evolve the presentation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we started out with a data model, some web services, default admin, and a skinny little presentation of the working application.  That original model, BTW, remains largely unchanged.  The most significant changes to that have stemmed from the Django 0.97 to 1.0 evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was fine until I figured out that the our proprietary business model was central.  So, we rebuilt the data model to reflect the business.  The web services didn't change much.  The default admin is still fine.  The presentation had to expand to cover the additional parts of the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Django model is in several parts.  In Django parlance we have many &amp;quot;applications&amp;quot;.  Each application is a subset of the overall model with a specific subject-area focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That structure was fine until I figured out how our proprietary business model gets built in the first place.  Now we have to revise everything yet again to create a more sophisticated Django model that reflects how the business &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt;  operates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="refactoring"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Refactoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's all just Python, so the refactoring is very, very low cost.  If this was Java, we'd be paralyzed by the cost of rework.  For Java folks, redoing the database and the ORM layers would be a hellish cost that would lead to terrible workarounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Django and Python, however, we fix the model, and the SQL takes care of itself.  The admin takes care of itself (for now).  We will have to rework the presentation, but that's only a few dozen template files that have to be adjusted to handle the new relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardest part will be reworking the various view functions.  But, because of the way Django works, there are only a few places to look for changes there.  The Django ORM layer allows us to ignore many of the model changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Python site-packages directory, IMO, is for packages that have two important criteria.  First, they have to be widely reusable.  Second, they have (or would benefit from) a setup.py.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stand-alone /opt/someApp directory, on the other hand, is for finished applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, in the middle there's a lot of stuff.  What about sub-packages of an application?  How &amp;quot;reusable&amp;quot; do they have to be?  Finished or only potentially reusable?  What about multiple parts of an integrated system of applications?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, what about Django web applications which have relatively static application parts, plus relatively dynamic database and file uploads in the &amp;quot;media&amp;quot; directory?  What about command-line data management applications for bulk loads and transfers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And -- relative to Django apps -- what is settings.py?  Technically, it's code.  But, practically, it's just configuration.  When you have multiple run-time environments (Training and Production) with the same code base, it's just the settings.py that discriminates between the two database instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="registering-intent"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Registering Intent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision of where to put things often devolves to a matter of intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A package (or module) is an intellectual crutch.  We collocate class definitions in a module (or group modules into a package) to make a comprehensible intellectual chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criteria for &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sunnyday.mit.edu/16.355/parnas-criteria.html&amp;quot;"&gt;decomposing systems into modules&lt;/a&gt;  is pretty clear.  The essential module design is oriented around design decisions which can change.  But there is a taxonomy of design decisions.  Parnas provides some examples (Data Structures, Algorithms, API's, Performance.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, there are a few additional kinds of design decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;External WS APIs.  These are a separate package that can be installed in site-packages and distributed to clients.  Except, of course, that our application doesn't use them, so we don't need them in site-packages, only our customers do.  Still, the API rule should apply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Irrelevant&amp;quot; data structures.  Many files and external interfaces impose data structures which are largely irrelevant to our application.  External XSD's, for example, are part of an interface, not part of our core application.  Also, interestingly, the endless complexity of spreadsheets that are used as data sources lead to irrelevant details.  We've used &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.lexicon.net/sjmachin/xlrd.htm"&gt;XLRD&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-csv.html"&gt;csv&lt;/a&gt; .  Further, we're using a SAX parser for XML spreadsheets.  We can collect a lot of this in a &amp;quot;Workbook Library&amp;quot;.  It isn't core to our application, it's a distraction.  But it isn't a package we'll polish up and put into an open-source repository.  But it isn't core, either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools.  For example, we generate Python classes from XSD's.  Clearly, this is separate.  But, just as clearly, it isn't very polished, and not usable as a stand-alone tool.  Do we leave this inside the main application directory under /opt/someApp?  Or do we register our intent to make it a stand-alone product and toss it into a separate /opt/someTool directory?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A web admin I respect said &amp;quot;It doesn't matter what you choose, someone will hate your decision.&amp;quot;  Helpful advice.  In other words, &amp;quot;quit waffling -- it can't be perfect.&amp;quot;  Indeed, what would &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; even mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's important seem to be the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modularize Everything&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The magic number is 7 ± 2 &amp;quot;concepts&amp;quot; in a module.  A few closely related classes go in a module.  More complex modules tend to be a problem.  When you're in a hurry and it isn't clear where the boundaries should fall, go for smaller.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think Packages&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;I'm starting to see that there's nothing wrong with a package that contains a single __init__.py file; this is a place-holder for future growth.  You can add to this structure easily.  I think this should be what you put down in the first sprint to get things started.  Later it can be refactored as the design matures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;If, after a few months, the overall direction seems to have shifted, that package can be collapsed back into a module -- with no breakage.  I find it slightlly easier to refactor a single-module package into a module than to decompose a growing (and possibly bloated) module into a multi-file package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written Justification&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;You need tidy, clear, documentation for your overall structure.  Be particularly focused on introducing newbies to your project.  It has to make compelling sense -- you have to know that your colleagues will do the right kind of design.  Few things are as challenging as the &amp;quot;you're right, it probably doesn't belong there&amp;quot; conversation surrounding some particularly egregious hand-waving.  It's most helpful with a n00b: they can see the irregularities more clearly than you can.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="our-stuff"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got a collection of /opt/this and /opt/that directories for the various &amp;quot;top-level&amp;quot; components.  Right now, we're using /opt/this/this-1.1 and /opt/that/that-2.1 kind of names.  These map to subversion tagged versions.  The idea is that we have version 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 all side-by-side.  We try to avoid replacing a previous version so that we can fall-back -- if necessary -- during an attempted upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of our &amp;quot;big&amp;quot; application systems we have /var/opt/this/prod and /var/opt/this/training for our &amp;quot;working&amp;quot; directory trees.  This allows us to more easily manage production, QA, training, staging and other parallel implementations of the same baseline application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our small applications (and packages) have their own /opt directories.  Some don't have their own /var/opt working directories, since they're used by our big applications.  Many potentially reusable packages have setup.py scripts and are also installed into site-packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're making an intentional effort to be absolutely sure that nothing in /home is ever used anywhere.   When your application is big (hundreds of files) it's easy to overlook something.  Sadly, I've looked at a fair amount of software where a poorly-chosen path to a module was snuck in somewhere and there were file conflicts that occurred rarely and made the software &amp;quot;flaky&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://krow.livejournal.com/599921.html"&gt;Prepared Statements, Musings&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot; and &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pooteeweet.org/blog/0/1201#m1201"&gt;Prepared statements are dead, long live prepared statements&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &amp;quot;musings&amp;quot; we're told &amp;quot;...users do not clean up/close unused prepared statements.&amp;quot;  For this reason, they're bad, and should be avoided.  Eventually, &amp;quot;...unless you really happen to know what you are doing with them, you are going to crash the database.&amp;quot; Clearly, this isn't true; you only crash the application connection to the database.  The database itself generally keeps on grinding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that failure to close statements properly doesn't crash &amp;quot;the database&amp;quot;.  I did this wrong in a data warehouse application.  DB2 didn't crash, just the long-running applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &amp;quot;long live prepared statements&amp;quot; there's the implication that prepared statements are slow, or slower than single statements, or unsuitable for web transactions because (a) application servers are no good, (b) connection pooling doesn't work or (c) prepared statements involve multiple trips to the server.  There may be other reasons in the posting, also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="benchmark"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benchmark&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Prepared Statements suffer from two flaws:  Higher overhead -- because we have to actually close them -- and Poor performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first complaint is not a tough problem.  As far as I'm concerned, we can't cater to incompetent programmers by risking huge security flaws.  If people can't follow the API -- well -- they need help or they need new careers.  Allowing them to write flawed software isn't helpful in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&amp;quot;But that's the hand we're dealt,&amp;quot; managers whine, &amp;quot;we don't have genius programmers.&amp;quot;  You don't need geniuses.  You just need QA.  &amp;quot;But we don't have the budget for QA.&amp;quot;  Ah.  If you don't have the budget to create quality, then you do have the budget to create crap.  Enjoy it while you can.  But don't complain about the outsourcing.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second complaint -- it appears -- is unlikely to be true.  See &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://itsaloadofblog.blogspot.com/2008/03/performance-using-bind-variables-in.html"&gt;Performance using Bind Variables in a Java Application&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;.   Looks pretty clear to me.  Bind variables are faster.  Also, see &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.performancewiki.com/bind-variables.html"&gt;Use Bind Variables for Application Performance&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="exceptions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exceptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are stories of query plans turning to crap with a bind variable but being delightfully optimal with a constant.  This is -- sadly -- incorrect for Oracle.  It may be true for other databases.  A quick benchmark would provide proof for other products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.db-nemec.com/HappyNewPeek.html"&gt;Execution Plan and Reality&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;.  Specifically, &amp;quot;The ... explain plan statement allows ... a query containing bind variables without actually defining these variables,... The optimiser must use the default rule to calculate the selectivity of the predicates with bind variables. The result could be very different from the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; execution plan based on the peeked values and known data types of bind variables. This is the reason why the execution plan generated by explain plan was so different from the actual one.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Oracle's explain plan -- with bind variables -- is the worst-case scenario, and not to be trusted.  Good to know.  Don't casually cut-and-paste code for explain plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepared Statements must be closed.  If you can't follow the API, get help or get another kind of job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepared Statements (and bind variables) are not inherently slow.  When in doubt, benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now read &lt;a class="reference external" href="Twistedradix:thisisarant"&gt;Twisted Radix: This is a Rant&lt;/a&gt; .  Oh.  I get it.  The comments in the original article &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;  a riot. Bottom Line: there's no point in adding a layer like GreenSQL.  You don't need to &amp;quot;check&amp;quot; for SQL injection attacks, since it's easier to simply prevent them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just use bind variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than layer on extra software, one should just read the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2007"&gt;OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;  and address them systematically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;A1 Cross Site Scripting.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Assume all user inputs include hidden javascript, and do appropriate HTML encoding.  &lt;strong&gt;Do HTML Encoding.&lt;/strong&gt;   That's it.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;A2 Injection Flaws.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Never build strings of anything, particularly SQL.  Use bind variables, or similar techniques like HTML encoding.  That's all.  Don't layer in extra junk.  &lt;strong&gt;Use.  Bind.  Variables.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;A3 Malicious File Execution.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Assume all user files are binaries that will cause problems.  Validate the contents and segregate them into &amp;quot;media&amp;quot; directories that can't be used for other purposes.  Django uses PIL to validate image files.  And Django never accepts a filename from the web -- it generates its own.  &lt;strong&gt;Always Generate Filenames&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;A4 Insecure Direct Object Reference.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This is subtle, since REST demands a direct object reference.  Providing a reference isn't a problem, as long as object dereferencing has appropriate authorization checks.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;A5 Cross Site Request Forgery.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This is complicated -- there are a lot of use cases for bookmarking and spoofing form data.  It's handled by Django in a pretty cool way -- a simple hidden field with a unique token that must come back as sent.  This is the &amp;quot;nonce&amp;quot; technique used in digest authentication.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;A6 Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;That's what logs are for.  HTML bletches are a big mistake.  When in doubt, show 500.html and keep quiet.  &lt;strong&gt;Don't Debug via End-User HTML&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;A7 Broken Authentication and Session Management.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Here's a tip: use a framework that does this -- &lt;strong&gt;Don't Roll Your Own&lt;/strong&gt;™.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;A8 Insecure Cryptographic Storage.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Like A5, this is tough: everyone wants to use crypto, but no one knows how to do key management.  A hard-coded key is useless.  Encrypted databases are only as secure as the keys, and the keys never seem to get handled properly.  Also, you have keep the database behind a firewall so only the web server itself has access.  Never store passwords, only digests of passwords.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;A9 Insecure Communications.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;SSL is easy.  Use it.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;A10 Failure to Restrict URL Access.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Obscurity is not Security.  You can't say &amp;quot;no one will find the backdoor URL for debugging.&amp;quot;  They will.  Plan on it.  Either secure it, or don't do it.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no room for after-the-fact glue like GreenSQL.  All of the OWASP vulnerabilities are solved in the basic design of the framework you chose and the application built on that framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An application that assembles SQL on the fly is flawed to begin with, and no amount of patching will fix it.  It's an arms race between SQL injection tricks and software filtering.  Someone can always create SQL so confusingly complex that the tool is fooled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, everything you add can add bugs and vulnerabilities.  Less software is better; no software is best.  Keep it lean, simple and secure.&lt;/p&gt;

Budgeting. Metrics. Hiring. Documenting. Transitioning to new staff.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good point.  Let's look at these in a little bit of depth.  We'll cover the three management practices first: Budgeting, Metrics and Personnel (Hiring and Transitioning to new staff.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="budgeting"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Budgeting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got to have budgets.  How much does a project cost?  How do we estimate the costs?  Two ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2008_02_14-why_agile_whats_the_point.html"&gt;Why Agile? What's the Point?&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot; I talked a little about the cost and risk question.  Mostly from a risk point of view.  In short, with an Agile approach, the risks have almost no associated cost.  What little cost there is should be easy to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about overall cost?  What's the &amp;quot;total cost to do [X]?&amp;quot;  Well...  First, we have to define [X] so we can define the total cost.  In order to define [X], we have to throw Agile out the window and create a &lt;strong&gt;Big Plan Up Front&lt;/strong&gt;.  Oops.  That didn't work, did it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do we do about total cost?  The question has to be reframed.  There's a central issue here.  The central issue is this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="we-can-t-know-what-done-means"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We Can't Know What &amp;quot;Done&amp;quot; Means&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't want to waste time trying to talk about &amp;quot;Totally Done&amp;quot; -- it's unknowable.  We can only talk about &amp;quot;Done Enough&amp;quot;.  Projects often die because the scope is too ambitious or too nebulous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't know the total cost for [X] because we really don't know everything there is to know about [X].  Further, we know that the users are prone to lying, so we we can't ever be sure we really know what the totality of [X] is; [X] gets shifty and is hard to pin down.  Rather, we have to find out what the biggest share of [X] is; what part of [X] causes the most pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to avoid questions of total cost.  Instead, we have to reframe budget conversations as questions of the rate at which money is spent and the rate at which features arrive.  If we have people we trust with high-powered tools, they'll build us stuff at an acceptable rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, the stakeholders will run out of high-priority, high-value things to do.  That's when we're approaching &amp;quot;Done Enough&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-real-questions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Real Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two questions more important than &amp;quot;budget&amp;quot; -- budget in the simplistic sense of &amp;quot;total cost&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question is one of performance.  At what rate will features arrive?   With an established staff and established tools, they should be able to commit to a rate of delivery that doesn't include a lot of surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second question is one of expectations.  At what rate do we need features?  This is a question to the stakeholders.  If they need a lot of features right away, we might have to assign a big team.  If they're willing to wait, we might get away with a smaller team.  After the first few releases, we can probably cut back on the rate of delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we know our rate of delivery and our stakeholder's demands, we can figure out how many people we'll need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what's the duration?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For large projects, the duration is &amp;quot;the rest of this year.&amp;quot;  After all, that's the real answer most of the time.  And everything will be renegotiated next year.  Why pitch a multi-year plan when you have to redo it every single year?  Just pitch a &amp;quot;for the rest of this year&amp;quot; plan; that's the honest, useful truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For small projects, you might know that it's only a few releases or a few sprints.  For bug fixes it's usually one sprint-one release.  And you often have historical data with which to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom Line -- budget is easy.  It requires an honest assessment of multi-year projects: namely, you'll plan them one year at a time, since they're only approved one year at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="metrics"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Metrics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people are in favor of metrics.  &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.dorsethouse.com/authors/bullock.html"&gt;Jim Bullock&lt;/a&gt;  says they're essential.  However, let's not waste a lot of time and effort on measurements we can't make much use of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I'm enamored of the &amp;quot;project dashboard&amp;quot; efforts to try and boil project status down to red, green and yellow lights.  The first thing everyone does is debate the metrics, since there's no standard practices for this.  Then, no one can supply &amp;quot;quality&amp;quot; data.  Why?  Standard reason: No stakeholders, nothing's at stake.  It's barely even a convenience item.  Seriously, what are the use cases?]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, metrics are either a part of the culture or they're a roadblock.  If you already measure and count stuff, then you've got metrics covered, and you can Start Now on meaningful work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metrics are a roadblock when you have to organize the metrics as part of defining scope and deliverables and budget and staffing and all the folderol we're trying to skip over.  If you feel metrics are necessary, then you've got to get started.  As with all things, start with one person; have them watch and count work products of one other person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say &amp;quot;you are what you measure&amp;quot;.  Consequently, the most important thing to measure is &amp;quot;delivered features&amp;quot;.  Measure the following: request backlog, sprints and releases.  Start there.  For that matter -- since these are the things the stakeholders see -- end there, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say &amp;quot;you can't control what you can't measure&amp;quot;.  What's important, however, is that &amp;quot;you may &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;  be able to control the things you can measure&amp;quot;.  You can measure the height of the tide, but you can't change it.  Be sure you understand cause and effect in the things you're measuring.  Don't measure stuff where you don't know or can't control the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardest part about a metrics program is trying to use metrics to achieve organizational change.  It's really hard -- harder than you'd believe possible.  I saw one group try to achieve better reuse by measuring code delivered and code reused.  They, essentially, didn't count the reused code as part of a manager's overall delivery.  However, they measured productivity in lines of code per day.  So, when a manager elected to reuse some code, the team did some work for which there were no lines of code delivered.  The productivity metric would decline if you reused something.  This is the Unintended Consequence problem of trying to shape behavior with metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring and Staffing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I don't have much to say here that hasn't already been said.  Start by reading everything there is on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.agileadvice.com/archives/2005/04/pair_programmin.html"&gt;Pair Programming&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure that staffing is a proper project cost, &lt;em&gt;per se.&lt;/em&gt;   I think it's an organizational cost.  I don't think a specific project should be hiring and training people.  You need to apportion those costs across all projects.  Maybe renting contractors, but not hiring permanent staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The customer sees the flow of features -- from backlog to sprint to release.  They don't see -- or care a whit -- about staffing to produce those features.  Since it's all about the feature, the customer is paying for features, not training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with backups, restores, networks, firewalls, storage, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, clean water and coffee service, staff is a kind of infrastructure.  Perhaps the most important infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But,&amp;quot; folks say, &amp;quot;it takes time/effort/money/risk to bring a new person up to speed.&amp;quot;  Agreed.  Do it quietly and quickly.  Agile suggests pair programming.  Two people linked with a chat client (or sitting in the same office) can get a lot done.  One can be junior and one can be senior.  It works great.  The cost to introduce someone new is really quite low when done this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is generally technical.  You've got to have it.  I didn't mention it because I thought it went without saying.  However, identifying it is good; it clarifies it as an Agile practice and prevents it from being overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that powerful documentation tools are essential.  And MS-Word (or Open Office) isn't one of those tools.  I really like tools like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/"&gt;epydoc&lt;/a&gt;  for producing nice API docs from code.  I also like the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/"&gt;docutils&lt;/a&gt;  rst2html.py script for producing nice docs from simple text files.  90% of documentation is text.  Make life simple and simply type the text.  Formatting can be done separately using the simple rules of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html"&gt;ReStructuredText&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is still embodied in two words: Start Now.  It means going easy on the up-front junk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting started on an Agile project does not mean that we casually toss out &amp;quot;Budgeting. Metrics. Hiring. Documenting. Transitioning to new staff.&amp;quot;  What it means is to do these things realistically.  You can't know everything.  Don't waste time making assumptions, then discovering the assumptions are wrong and revising the project plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask what the stakeholders need to know to commit to a decision.  They don't know everything, either.  They need to know enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budget is a flow of money.  For big, multi-year projects, it's a flow for the foreseeable future -- so just plan one year at a time.  Don't make up a five-year plan that will get rewritten 20 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metrics are a reflection of what has happened.  Be sure to measure things that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring and staffing are the heart of Agile methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation is essential.  Tools matter.  Use the most productive tools you can find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very cool restatement of some essential Agile principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sure, we can train and plan -- and we should. But there are too many unknowns to train and plan for everything. A slow ramp-up lets us discover and kill problems as we go, reducing complexity at every step. Going slowly means fewer changes at once, fewer nasty surprises, fewer problems leaking out of the data center. It also means direct, desperately needed experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But to go slowly, we have to move fast. We can't wait for an ROI analysis or a line item in the budget to start getting that experience. We can start right now, today, with a tiny pilot that gets us moving.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you Frank Hayes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="planning-is-important"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Planning Is Important&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last refuge of the technologically obsolete manager is planning.  If you can't understand all the new techno-mumbo-jumbo, you can at least understand dates and budgets.  Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong.  If you don't get the techno-mumbo-jumbo, you need to invest more time with real technical people soaking up the technology.  Watch the team at work.  Don't coach.  Watch.  Don't answer your phone.  Don't yammer.  Watch.  I've seen this done, and it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A realistic plan requires a realistic understanding of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-case-study"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Case Study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, let's talk about introducing some kind of configuration management for the DBA's.  (See &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2008_08_06-the_schema_evolution_problem.html"&gt;The Schema Evolution Problem&lt;/a&gt;.)  Doesn't that require a &lt;strong&gt;BPFC&lt;/strong&gt; ?  How will we achieve &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; without a plan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plan is not step one.  A plan is not important or even very helpful.  At best it's a distraction.  At worst it takes on a life of its own and replaces real work with servicing the plan through short-cuts and work-arounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step one is to understand what we mean by &amp;quot;control.&amp;quot;  Not the dictionary definition.  Not the wikipedia definition of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_management"&gt;Configuration Management&lt;/a&gt;  or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_Management_(ITSM)"&gt;Change Management&lt;/a&gt; .  That's evasive -- evasive in a criminal kind of way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before embarking on a formalized Schema Evolution exercise, step one is to gather specific use cases for the configuration management processes.  In the current organization, who are the stakeholders?  What do they need to know about the current configuration?  What will the developers do?  What will QA do? What will the DBA's do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before doing anything, we need to identify who has a stake in configuration control, schema version control and change management.  Everyone's involved.  Who's committed?  Who should control configuration of the various development, test and production realms? What are the various actor's goals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Review the old saw about the ham and eggs breakfast.  The chicken is involved.  The pig is committed.  Who are the pigs?  Who are the chickens?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;  to write specific, detailed scenarios.  We're just going to summarize their goals; summarize their interactions with some &amp;quot;system&amp;quot; that will manage change and control configurations.  We need guidance on tool use.  We don't need yet another set of &amp;quot;requirements&amp;quot; that allow someone to engage in lots more programming.  The point is to increase control and reduce cost, not write more stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The most dangerous person in the organization is the person who wants to spend all day writing Visual Studio plug-ins to &amp;quot;automate&amp;quot; some task that isn't very complicated in the first place.  Sigh.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="now-do-we-plan"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Now Do We Plan?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have identified stakeholders, goals and use case summaries (no steps, just overviews), we have a jumping-off point.  But not for planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we have at this point are people who make all kind of outrageous claims.  Everyone wants to be in charge -- they claim they're pigs -- but they're mostly just chickens.  The claims are contradictory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DBA's, generally, claim that they own the configuration.  They control the stored procedures, but not the application software; leading to a split in the software.  They can't really justify their position, it's got too many holes in it -- they answer to users for production operations as well as new development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Developers, generally, claim that they own the configuration, since the database is just there to support their fancy new applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QA, interestingly, often says that they don't own the configuration.  I've met a fair number of QA folks that are behind the technology curve and don't feel comfortable &amp;quot;owning&amp;quot; the configuration.  Instead, they tolerate someone else owning configuration and track the changes from a safe distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Managers will often try to control the configuration by issuing random orders from time to time.  &amp;quot;Don't change anything without checking with me&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Fix something as soon as you know it's wrong&amp;quot; being the usual contradictory orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="you-say-you-re-a-stakeholder"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You Say You're A Stakeholder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase Stakeholder is usually a broad, vague thing that encompasses everyone.  But who has something &amp;quot;at stake?&amp;quot;  Who has something they'll lose?  And how significant is that loss?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DBA's, for example, have no skin the game.  If nothing changes, they're happiest.  For them, an immutable configuration where they do backups and run SQL as part of production operations is the ideal.  Why try to introduce change management or version control to people who explicitly reject it?  DBA's often act as the technical hands pushing buttons on behalf of the users.  The users have more to loose than the DBA's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Most DBA's will tell you that change control on a schema is impossible.  They reject &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tools.html"&gt;Agile Database Tools and Scripts&lt;/a&gt; .]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers have a something at stake.  If they're doing bug fixes, they need changes to be marched through some QA into production.  They're interested in improving existing production operations.  Developers doing new development, they have a new environment or application they need created, qualified and commissioned for production use.  They're interested in creating new production operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, QA has everything at stake.  They are -- in principle -- responsible for production operations, change fixes and new development.  QA has to be an active participant in change management procedures; they (and only they) can manage the configurations running in each working realm (production, test, development, etc.)  QA has to be able to use SVN (or CVS or whatever) to confirm what's there and what's supposed to be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think QA are the pigs in this ham-and-eggs breakfast.  Everyone else is just a chicken.  The users should be working directly with QA.  QA should be actively managing DBA and developer changes to provide an Information Technology architecture that meet the user's needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="okay-we-ve-resolved-the-conflicts-now-can-we-plan"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Okay, We've Resolved the Conflicts, Now Can We Plan?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we've worked out who the actors really are, and what they need to know, the rest is simply following Frank Hayes' advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start a pilot.  Without a plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with one person working with QA to put one thing under configuration control; create the necessary change management; identify how to do version control.  Often, we have some of this in place for some of the source code.  Rarely does anyone have this in place for DDL and configuration files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, simply expand the existing repository to contain one more thing.  Just one.  Pick the highest priority, most problematic, biggest, ugliest problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, it's something like stored procedures not matching between databases.  Just start there.  We already have some application source; why not get the rest of the application code under control?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get just the stored procedures into SVN.  Get the checkout areas squared away for each realm (test, production, QA, development, etc.)  Get things in and out.  Create branches and start tagging just the stored procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live with this a while.  Get this under control.  Don't put a date or a deliverable around it.  Learn some lessons.  Make changes.  Back away from mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="okay-we-finished-the-pilot-now-can-we-plan"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Okay, We Finished The Pilot.  Now Can We Plan?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning prematurely is a mistake.  One set of lessons learned doesn't reveal too many reproducible patterns.  Patterns become visible after you've done something two or three times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, find the &lt;strong&gt;Next Big Thing&lt;/strong&gt;.  Start a &amp;quot;round 2 pilot&amp;quot;.  Not a full implementation.  No concrete plan.  Nothing so serious as that.  Just pick something that's out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, table definitions that don't match.  Start putting DDL into SVN.  Work out a way to compare a schema in the database with the DDL in the SVN source area.  (This is pretty hard, and often involves creating a temp DB and comparing the an established schema with the temp schema.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work out a solution for the ALTER problem.  It's often best to rewrite the table CREATE statement, and provide a separate ALTER as a kind of one-use-only script.  Some people can't -- for some reason -- make this work, and have to execute the historical sequence of creates and alters to get a schema into a trusted configuration.  You need a way to match what you start with -- a change -- and what you end up with -- a schema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expand the repository to contain one more thing.  Live with this DDL management for a while.  Create branches and start tagging the CREATEs and ALTERs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live with this a while.  Get this under control.  Don't put a date or a deliverable around it.  Learn some lessons.  Make changes.  Back away from mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fine-we-ve-done-the-pilot-twice-now-can-we-plan"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fine.  We've Done The Pilot Twice.  Now Can We Plan?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have useful lessons learned -- and enough experience to see patterns emerging -- feel free to plan away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's left is usually the configuration files themselves.  All of the various settings and what-not that configure each piece of the technology stack.  That's usually pretty straightforward to put under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll notice that what's left after that is minor.  You've already tackled the stored procedure and DDL problems.  There won't be much budget or enthusiasm for the few things that remain.  Feel free to plan -- that will allow for lots of high-level meetings where nothing gets done because nothing's at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining things will be resolved by people saying &amp;quot;Why isn't the index creation in the repository?&amp;quot;  Or &amp;quot;Why aren't the backup scripts in the repository?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, stuff will move into the repository with no plan, no powerpoint, no budget, no management buy-in.  Folks will have the experience and the enthusiasm to put stuff under control without an elaborate management ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="wait-what"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wait -- what?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did something happen without a plan?  How can we fix our CM problem without a BPFC?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy.  If you start small enough, you don't need a big plan.  The Big Plan for Change usually fails to identify what's at stake, and who's bearing the brunt of failure.  With nothing at stake, nothing needs to change, and nothing gets done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configuration Management -- like many things -- can be tackled incrementally.  You don't have to boil the entire ocean; you just need to establish one best practice cheaply, simply, quietly and -- above all -- immediately.  Find the biggest problem.  What's at stake?  For whom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;whole job&amp;quot; may appear big.  But that doesn't mean it requires a big plan.  It requires a small statement of vision.  Then, use the following two words: &amp;quot;Start Now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="some-use-cases"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some Use Cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The subject matter experts will tinker with the spreadsheets.  They'll invent new cases, revise old cases, retract cases.  You'll be regenerating the test suite constantly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The subject matter experts cannot reliably produce spreadsheets in a consistent format.  Get over it.  You'll be endlessly adjusting the conversion from spreadsheet to test suite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You'll be evolving the test cases as your application evolves.  You'll need to regenerate the whole test suite as you refactor your API's.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="components"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Components&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To read spreadsheets, download &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.lexicon.net/sjmachin/xlrd.htm"&gt;xlrd&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To write the JUnit framework TestCase code, download &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.makotemplates.org/"&gt;Mako&lt;/a&gt; .  There are many template engines (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/"&gt;Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.myghty.org/"&gt;Myghty&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://genshi.edgewall.org/"&gt;Genshi&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.kid-templating.org/"&gt;Kid&lt;/a&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I chose Mako because it is relatively lightweight and works well as a stand-alone component.  Cheetah, for instance, is hard to control for small, specialized jobs -- it seems to prefer having the ability to create relatively complex intermediate files.  Django's template can be separated from the rest of Django, but why download all that when you just want something simple.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="patterns"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patterns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall design pattern for this is a &lt;strong&gt;Translator&lt;/strong&gt;.  This has three elements: the &lt;strong&gt;Deep Structure&lt;/strong&gt;  -- the actual meaning -- plus a &lt;strong&gt;Reader&lt;/strong&gt;  and a &lt;strong&gt;Writer&lt;/strong&gt;.  The Reader builds a Deep Structure from external data in one representation.  The Writer emits the Deep Structure in another representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to keep these three things disentangled.  You are likely to have several source spreadsheet formats, all of which lead to the same essential test case.  Similarly, you will have several test case formats that you are emitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a piece of the spreadsheet we're starting with.  This has a Source section that defines three attributes (&amp;quot;Name&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Batch&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Count&amp;quot;) and two entities.  It has a Result section that defines one entity with the same three attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="33%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="33%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="33%" /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Name&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Batch&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Count&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;SomeLongName&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;some_long_name&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Name&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Batch&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Count&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;SomeLongName&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Let's pretend this is sample data for some kind of complicated matching algorithm that uses names, batch id numbers and counts to determine how things match.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="deep-structure"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deep Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each test case generator will have a unique deep structure.  For the purposes of showing this recipe, we need to pick some kind of data model.  One common feature is that your test cases will be based on data entities.  The entities are more-or-less explicitly defined by row in the spreadsheet.  The overall test case, however, is usually implied by a series of rows with -- perhaps -- headers or notes or trailers or something to provide context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your actual situation will obviously vary so widely that it's dangerous even providing a sample data model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
class Entity( dict ):
    name= property( lambda self: self['name'] )
    batch= property( lambda self: self['batch'] )
    count= property( lambda self: self['count'] )

class Case( object ):
    def __init__( self, fileName, sheetName ):
        self.fileName= fileName
        self.sheetName= sheetName
        self.source= []
        self.result= []
    def __str__( self ):
        return &amp;quot;%s:%s&amp;quot; % ( self.fileName, self.sheetName )
    def addEntity( self, entity ):
        self.source.append( entity )
    def addResult( self, entity ):
        self.result.append( entity )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows the Entity and the Case classes.  Yes, Entity is essentially a dict.  It's handy to conceive of the data coming from a spreadsheet as a dict.  Think of the csv package DictReader as the &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; API.  Then develop a method for using xlrd to produce dict structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The properties allow us to say entity.name instead of entity['name'].  We could write a more generic version of __getattr__, but that generally leads to more complexity in handling overrides and exceptions.  Most business Entities will have rather complex definitions with many attributes and methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test Case, in this example, has some identifying information, some source Entities from the spreadsheet and a result Entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-reader"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Reader&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll have a Reader.  (Sometimes you'll have a class hierarchy with multiple readers, depending on how well your SME's can produce sample data.)  The Reader's job is to parse the spreadsheet and yield Cases.  It does as little as possible to build the Case.  Most data conversion or calculation is part of the Case or the Writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
class Reader( object ):
    def __init__( self, aFileName ):
        self.fileName= aFileName
        self.wb= xlrd.open_workbook( aFileName )
        self.log= logging.getLogger( &amp;quot;Reader&amp;quot; )
    def rowIter( self, sheet ):
        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Yield all rows of a given sheet.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
        for r in range( sheet.nrows ):
            self.log.debug( &amp;quot;Input %d: %r&amp;quot;, r, sheet.row(r) )
            yield r, sheet.row(r)
    def getCases( self, *sheetNames ):
        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Process given sheets to yield all Cases in this file.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
        sheetList= [ self.wb.sheet_by_name(n) for n in sheetNames ]
        for sheet in sheetList:
            rows= self.rowIter( sheet )
            for c in self.parseCase( self.fileName, sheet.name, rows ):
                yield c
    def parseCase( self, fileName, sheetName, rowIter ):
        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Yield cases from this sheet's row iterator.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
        case= Case( fileName, sheetName )
        # Find the Source line
        for r, row in rowIter:
            if is_string(row[0]) and row[0].value == 'Source':
                break
        # Next line is the source column headings
        r, header= rowIter.next()
        labels= [ c.value.lower() for c in header ]
        # Entities defined until the Result line
        for r, row in rowIter:
            if is_blank( row ): continue
            if is_string(row[0]) and row[0].value == &amp;quot;Result&amp;quot;: break
            values= [ c.value for c in row ]
            rowDict= dict( zip( labels, values ) )
            self.log.debug( 'entity %d: %r', r, rowDict )
            e= Entity( rowDict )
            case.addEntity( e )
        # Next line is the result column headings
        r, header= rowIter.next()
        labels= [ c.value.lower() for c in header ]
        # Remaining lines are the result entities
        for r, row in rowIter:
            if is_blank( row ): continue
            values = [ c.value for c in row ]
            rowDict= dict( zip( labels, values ) )
            self.log.debug( 'result %d: %r', r, rowDict )
            e= Entity( rowDict )
            case.addResult( e )
        yield case
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows the typical structure for a Reader.  You use it with the following kind of loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
r= Reader( fileName )
    for c in r.getCases(&amp;quot;Sheet1&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Summary&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Exception&amp;quot;):
        print c
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why list the sheets explicitly?  Depends on the structure of &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt;  source files.  You may be able to simply iterate through the sheets.  Or you may have sheets that have to be skipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="utility-functions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Utility Functions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the three utility functions the Reader uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
def is_empty( aCell ):
    return aCell.ctype == xlrd.XL_CELL_EMPTY
def is_string( aCell ):
    return aCell.ctype == xlrd.XL_CELL_TEXT
def is_blank( aRow ):
    return all( [ is_empty(c) or is_string(c) and len(c.value) == 0 for c in aRow ] )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-template-based-writer"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Template-Based Writer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you'll have one standard writer that covers all of the test cases.  Of course, there may be exceptions or alternatives or other complexities.  Here's a Writer that uses Mako Templates to generate a Java JUnit TestCase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
class Writer( object ):
    def __init__( self ):
        self.template= Template( &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;\
&amp;lt;%
    import datetime
    now = datetime.datetime.now()
    e1= case.source[0]
    e2= case.source[1]
    r1= case.result[0]
%&amp;gt;\
// Generated from ${case.fileName} ${case.sheetName}
// On ${now}
// By Unittest/generator.py ${version}
package some.app.test.${case.sheetName};
import junit.framework.TestCase;
import some.app.model.Entity;
import some.app.view.SomeClass;

/**
 * Unit test ${case.sheetName}:
 * exercises SomeClass.aMethod on two entities.
 * &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; ${e1}
 * &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; ${e2}
 * &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Expected result: ${r1}.
 */
class Test_${case.sheetName} extends TestCase {
    Entity e1, e2;
    SomeClass sc;
    public void setUp() {
        e1= Entity( &amp;quot;${e1.name}&amp;quot;, ${e1.batch}, ${int(e1.count)} );
        e2= Entity( &amp;quot;${e2.name}&amp;quot;, ${e2.batch}, ${int(e2.count)} );
        sc= SomeClass();
    }
    public void testProcess() {
        aResult= sc.aMethod( e1, e2 );
        assertEquals( &amp;quot;${r1.name}&amp;quot;, aResult.name );
        assertEquals( ${r1.batch}, aResult.batch );
        assertEquals( ${int(r1.count)}, aResult.count );
    }
}
&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
        )
    def source( self, aCase ):
        return self.template.render( case=aCase, version=__version__ )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows a single, simple template.  Note that most of the code is the giant string with the Java code in it.  Mako reads files nicely, in case this inline string becomes uncomfortably long and complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that we do some processing in the Writer, some of which might be better defined in the Entity or the Case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, you'll have to mix and match Mako processing with your Writer class hierarchy and processing you do in your Entity and Case class definitions.  You want to minimize the processing in Mako, just because it's a bit obscure inside the template.  On the other hand, you don't want to push everything into the business Entity or test Case classes, since they're the &lt;strong&gt;Essential Meaning&lt;/strong&gt;  that is represented either as a spreadsheet or a JUnit unit test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-main-program"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Main Program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main program is just a wrapper that binds an instance of Reader and Writer to create some test cases from source files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
def main( fileName, *sheets ):
    log= logging.getLogger( &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; )
    r= Reader( fileName )
    w= Writer()
    for c in r.getCases(*sheets):
        log.info( &amp;quot;Case %s&amp;quot;, c )
        print w.source( c )

if __name__ == &amp;quot;__main__&amp;quot;:
    import sys
    logging.basicConfig( stream=sys.stderr, level=logging.INFO )
    main( &amp;quot;TestCase.xls&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Sheet1&amp;quot; )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the small script version of the main program.  This could be expanded to do complex parameter-parsing.  However, in these cases, it's sometimes just as simple to have an explicit list of which files and which sheets are being processed for the current release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the &amp;quot;print&amp;quot;-based solution isn't really the best.  One might prefer to open appropriate files and write the rendered template to them.  However, there are change-control issues with overwriting previous tests; you do need to confirm that the new tests compile, for example, before replacing the old tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="use-case-review"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use Case Review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the test cases change, it's easiest to simply slap the XLS files into subversion.  Then, subversion's youngest version number identifies the suite of test cases.  We can simply regenerate the JUnit source with our generator tool.  We have to run a quick &amp;quot;do the tests work?&amp;quot; sanity check and see what has changed.  If the changes are understood, this becomes the new suite of tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the spreadsheets will have inconsistencies, the &amp;quot;simply regenerate&amp;quot; never works out very well.  Each release of the source may require adjusting the generator to cope with someone's inability to copy and paste consistent column names.  Sigh.  We have split our design so that our Reader can evolve and change without breaking the deep structure or the test case Writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the application changes, the template will change.  We can simply regenerate the JUnit source.  After our quick &amp;quot;do the tests work?&amp;quot; we have made wholesale changes to the test cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

They claim that the application I reverse engineered from C and rewrote in Java didn't work for this one case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1.  Get clarification on the screen grab information.  The data labels don't match any of the 100's of unit test cases that we put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2.  The clarification remains incomplete, but time is passing, so I make some guesses and build a unit test case.  This case is a lot like the cases in spreadsheet X page Y-Z, so I copy the most similar method from that TestCase to create a new TestCase.  Yes, this is copy-and-paste reuse.  Yes it's bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fold in the new test case from the screen grab as best I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 3.  Originally, I had planned on step 3 being a day of debugging to either (a) find a super-subtle logic flaw or (b) find that this test case was so different from all others that &lt;strong&gt;We Have To Talk&lt;/strong&gt;.  The (b) case is surprisingly common.  Lots of people imagine the scope of the application as being something it isn't.  Often they lift up something that's not a complex edge or corner case; they single out something that is way out in left field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many business operations require people to make judgements.  It's common.  It's the thing software doesn't do well, and shouldn't do.  Many people routinely spend a long, boring day making essentially the same judgement call over and over again.  Often, this isn't a good candidate for automation because -- well -- software can't discuss or justify it's judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's step 3, however, was to send back the new test case.  It worked for me.  If it doesn't work for you, then there are two potential issues: (a) you changed something, or (b) I didn't transform the screen grab into a test case properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of (b), you could say that this unprofessional of me.  I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be able to translate their screen grab into a proper test case.  However, I think that there's an interface between users and developers and creating spreadsheets in a standard form should be their job.  I have hundreds of cases they already created in standard spreadsheets.  They should be able to maintain those spreadsheets, adding new cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a tool (800 lines of Python) to build Java JUnit TestCase classes from their spreadsheets.  That's my side of the interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bottom-line"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bug -&amp;gt; TestCase rules.  It's the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Probabilities are waved around like they're important.  They aren't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk management shouldn’t be confused with random Roulette/Craps/Blackjack kind events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The odds of failure aren't what matters -- it's always 1.0.  It's the &lt;em&gt;cost&lt;/em&gt;  of failure that matters.  And even that is just the overall importance of the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to be very careful with the work &amp;quot;Risk&amp;quot;.   Software risk management is about three simple things: (a) bad management, (b) gathering information (managing ignorance) and (c) planning for specific contingencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk as Bad Management&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risks aren't vague, blurry, random casino events.  There aren't odds.  Most risks are things which &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;  happen unless we take steps to prevent them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing -- except developer death or serious disease -- is about random risks.  It's about specific bad management that will unconditionally be a problem.  The only thing we may not know is the magnitude.  For example, let’s say we write an estimating assumption that there’s a risk that the test server won’t be ready on time.  This isn't &amp;quot;random&amp;quot;.  It's totally under our control.  We don't really &amp;quot;mitigate&amp;quot; this risk, we just order the server on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might say that there's a risk that sys admins won't have it ready on time -- the risk is that their time to deliver is variable -- could be a week, could be three weeks.  It appears random.  Even though you might want to describe it as random, it's a controllable, knowable event.  In this case, it's someone stealing the sysadmin resources out from under you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most bad management leads to rework.   You can't control everything, but the things you can't control aren't random.  They’re just irritating – and they're just rework.  You don't use random-event risk management.  You say &amp;quot;What if we’re wrong?  It will cost us $50K to get out of that mess.&amp;quot;  That's your contingency budget: a specific rework plan.  $50K for specific actions to solve a specific potential problem.  Not 10% of the project, but a plan to remedy the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="knowledge-and-ignorance"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Knowledge and Ignorance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of what passes for &amp;quot;risks&amp;quot; are &amp;quot;Things we don’t Know&amp;quot; mixed with &amp;quot;Things we didn’t even know to ask&amp;quot;.  Throw in the attitude of &amp;quot;New information looks like scope creep&amp;quot;, and learning becomes a problem.  These aren't a roll of the dice.  They're things we didn’t know, but figured we'd learn as we went along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &amp;quot;How many users?&amp;quot;  That's a business analysis question; they'll get to it.  We assumed it was a dozen.  If it’s 100, we have a change control issue.  This isn't a risk -- we assumed something going in, we knew we'd learn something during the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might say that there’s a &amp;quot;risk&amp;quot; that we guessed wrong in our initial assumptions.  It isn't, however.  It's learning.  Either we left room in the project to learn, or it devolves to basic bad management.  The answer wasn't known in advance, but it wasn't random, either.  It just wasn't known.  Guessing (&amp;quot;assuming&amp;quot;) isn't random – it's just that we could guess wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is simply a budget change.  If the number of users is 100 instead of 12, then we have to refigure the budget with the new information.  Unless you're saddled with &amp;quot;All Scope Change is Bad&amp;quot; mind-set, that's just a change.  Change based on stuff that was learned.  This isn't &lt;strong&gt;rework&lt;/strong&gt;; this is learning.  You say &amp;quot;What if this assumption is wrong?  It will cost us $50K to get out of that mess.&amp;quot; A specific rework plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="specific-contingency-plans"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Specific Contingency Plans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom-line: It’s all about contingency planning.  For each thing we don't know, we make up a number (an &amp;quot;assumption&amp;quot;) and a &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; $ multiplier to turn that number into a project cost.  When we finally get the real number, we apply the &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; $ multiplier and get the new project cost.  This is how change management happens -- each new thing we learn revises the budget.  Each mistake we make has to be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mistake -- when things that go wrong -- leads to rework.   This rework is a specific budget number we have to add.  For things we didn't know to ask in the first place, that’s plain old scope change based on stuff we learned.  It's also a budget number we add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management risks aren’t random.  They’re not like casino gambling or insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="risk-based-testing-2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Risk-Based Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk-based Testing builds priorities around two things: the importance of the feature and the impact of failure.  No odds involved in this:  importance is fixed, failure is certain, the cost of failure is predictable.  We simply rank our tests using importance and cost of failure to determine what gets tested first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since importance also drives Agile development, this is essentially a kind of Agile testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build stuff in order of importance -- test it in the same order.  I don't think Risk-Based Testing is very &amp;quot;interesting&amp;quot;; I think it's just the Agile practice renamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about &amp;quot;Impact of Failure?&amp;quot;  That is usually parallel with importance.  If it the impact of failure is low, then you don't really need software to automate it, do you?  If the risk of failure is low, you have work-arounds, fall-backs; you have contingency plans that aren't complex or expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, it's easy.  Listen to fewer people.

The point is that the &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt;  of &amp;quot;Gathering Business Requirements&amp;quot; usually leads to requirements that include a fair amount of crap.  Indeed, the more time and effort you spend in &amp;quot;gathering&amp;quot; the less value you actually gather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We're not talking about a failure mode for Gathering Business Requirements (GBR). We're talking about something more fundamental: the GBR phase of a project is a leading indicator that the project will fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put another way: GBR is a virtual guarantee that a project is building the wrong thing, so no amount of brilliant execution can save it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advice is to understand the problem, then solve it for yourself.  More fundamentally, build the minimum to actually solve it for yourself.  Zero frills.  None of the famous &amp;quot;we'll have to add features to create enough value to entice the users.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also see Jesse Noller's &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jessenoller.com/2008/08/12/steve-yegge-hits-a-homer-your-requirements-are-stupid/"&gt;Steve Yegge hits a homer: Your requirements are stupid&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;When you're thinking about requirements ask yourself this: If at the start, you can not describe exactly what your product does in under a minute - you've already got a problem.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's my takeaway from these folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually understand the user's problem.  Try to do their job with them looking over your shoulder.  Don't talk hypothetically about &amp;quot;requirements&amp;quot;; don't waste time on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_Method"&gt;MoSCoW&lt;/a&gt;  priorities.  Actually do their job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you actually understand the problem, build the software you need to solve the problem.  Focus on a simple, minimal, reliable, provable solution -- something that you can describe &amp;quot;with your hands in your pockets&amp;quot; -- something clear enough that it doesn't require professional educators, a power-point presentation or even on-line help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you have a solution, carefully fold in features.  Add features that you can articulate simply and clearly.  Cover an edge or corner case that you can describe; cover a major piece of functionality that's easy to articulate.  Be sure that the actual users truly &amp;quot;get&amp;quot; your vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written requirements documents are of nebulous value.  A backlog of features -- yes.  A summary of the use cases -- yes.  A data model or some sequence diagrams -- yes.  Detailed, blow-by-blow narrative with &amp;quot;shall&amp;quot; in each legally-binding sentence -- no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-do-you-create-schedule-and-budget"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do you create schedule and budget?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn't a tight, complete requirements document a prerequisite for a budget?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn't that what everyone says?  Establish scope (by gathering requirements) and then define the budget?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No.  Requirements are demonstrably NOT part of budgeting.  Most projects have a budget which is lodged in the heads of executives, business owners and buyers.  You can gather all the requirements you want.  If you go over that budget, you will have your requirements cut down to size.  If you run way under the budget, you will be given more work to do to spend all the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budget has nothing to do with requirements.  For that matter, schedule has nothing to do with requirements.  Try and change the schedule of a project.  Go ahead and try.  You're told to work smarter, not harder.  You're told that the date can't be moved.  You're told that some requirements have to be pushed into a later phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schedule and budget are defined long before Gathering Business Requirements is finished.  Often before it's even started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-do-we-get-for-our-money"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What do we get for our money?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &amp;quot;when will we be done?&amp;quot; is meaningless, &amp;quot;what do we get for are money?&amp;quot; is a meaningful question.  However, there's no simple answer.  Instead, this is a conversation topic, not a simple question.  Each incremental release gets more features.  Each piece of the backlog has a potential price and delivers something.  The priorities, the costs and the order of development reveal that buyers can change priorities, cut off the budget at any time and have some pile of useful software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automation for the sake of automation -- an unhealthy obsession -- leads to thick books of requirements.  A thick book of requirements will have no discernible ordering, no priorities.  A smelly pile of requirements often accompanies a contract that amounts to all-or-nothing development.  All requirements or none of them.  If none is a possible outcome, how valuable can this be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Basically, it was a list of cheap (or free) web resources that would provide a solid web presence with relatively low cost.  More importantly, it would move them off a legacy web presence that was completely customized, but wasn't really very well implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that, small for-profit businesses (especially sole proprietorships) can benefit from assembling a web presence out of Google Pages (or Yahoo! Geocities), a Blog, a Google Calendar and (possibly) a Google or Yahoo! group.  They also need a CRM solution (CLPsuite or Salesforce.com).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, instead of CRM, Member Management (MM, sometimes called Member Relationship Management to parallel Customer Relationship Management) is a potential part of the software portfolio for a small not-for-profit (NFP).  The NFP I was helping gets their support through grants and donations of time from the principals.  Member Management doesn't enter into their picture at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, clubs and churches are member supported.  For them, member management might make some sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="web-based-member-management"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web-Based Member Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, look at Capterra's Enterprise Software Directory under &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.capterra.com/membership-management-software"&gt;Membership Management&lt;/a&gt; .  It's a pretty good list.  Also, look under &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.capterra.com/church-management-software"&gt;Church Membership Software&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem is that some of these are toolkits, not complete, stand-alone applications.  A toolkit means you are programming and programming means you aren't really small (or aren't focused on your primary NFP mission.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second problem is that you have to choose between Customer Relationship Management and Member Management.  My Small NFP (and many small sole proprietorships) needs CRM (i.e. CLPsuite or Salesforce.com).  They don't need MM in any form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="synchronicity"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Synchronicity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't be synchronizing between member mailing lists.  You must chose one and only one approach.  The cost and complexity will suck the life out of your organization.  You can do bulk notifications to members with any of the following techniques:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Yahoo! Group or Google Group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A CRM solution (CLPsuite or Salesforce).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Member Management solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RSS or ATOM feeds based on your blog or web page changes.  This is pull, not push technology, so you won't really know who's reading your material.  This is very Web 2.0, but not very comfortable for people addicted to pushing their message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="connectivity-and-spamulation"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Connectivity and Spamulation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RSS/ATOM issue is important.  When I talk about this with Small NFP's, I call all bulk email &lt;em&gt;spam&lt;/em&gt;.  Even the &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; opt-in email that people sign up for is still -- in a way -- spam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small NFP's bristle when I call their email spam.  First, it's opt-in email.  People asked for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more importantly, some of the folks have the need to be &lt;strong&gt;sure&lt;/strong&gt;  (really &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt;) that their message is getting out.  Here's my bad news: you can't be sure anyone's reading your email newsletter.  If it doesn't get spam-filtered, it can still get ignored.  You just never know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With RSS/ATOM, they asked and they checked for updates.  This is much, much more effective than an email list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="member-management-solutions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Member Management Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have much real advice here.  When you Google for &amp;quot;web based member management software&amp;quot;, you get a bunch of hits, include Wild Apricot, Tendenci, ARC Solutions, IRM-Systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

It's in ComputerWorld's Development section, in an article by Heather Havenstein: &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;amp;articleId=9110219"&gt;Five Web 2.0 app dev lessons for enterprise IT&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;.  I think the article is mis-titled, since it's basically &amp;quot;Agile for Big IT.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the five techniques are motherhood and apple-pie items.  Some are a little too-cleverly worded to pound home the essential points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break the barrier between developers and end-users...  This is essential: crowds of managers and business analysts are not adding significant value.  A few key players to help the developers understand the problem domain are important.  A Business Analyst who is &amp;quot;translating&amp;quot; user requirements into IT jargon isn't helping.  A Business Analyst who is acting as architect or designer isn't helping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep it simple.  This is how you get to smaller, faster, better teams.  A bone-headed manager who claims that we have to add features to &amp;quot;justify the cost&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;create sufficient value&amp;quot; is just empire-building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stick to the script.  This means use Python or some other powerful, dynamic language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release early and often.  In the Computerworld comments, this point raised some ire.  The claim is that the folks in operations won't able to keep up with rapid, small releases.  This assertion is demonstrably false.  Folks in operations can't handle the twice-each-year releases because each release is such a massive change that it (a) never works and (b) there's no going back.  Folks in operations will -- easily -- handle a twice-each-week release because the releases will (a) work, and (b) have a clear fall-back to the previous release (except twice each year when there's no easy fallback.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let the users -- not the developers -- determine the new features.  This is stated incorrectly.  The developers sometimes head down dark rat-holes of lost time.  Usually, it's the bone-head manager who started the project with &amp;quot;we have to add features to create sufficient value&amp;quot; that determined a list of useless gold-plating features.   Developers don't mind focus.  Empire-building managers will (a) add features and then (b) demand that something be shipped on-time even if it doesn't work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="making-changes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list is a handy recipe for making changes in an IT organization.  First -- of course -- people need to know that there's a problem.  You have to recognize that the waterfall model (Big Design Up Front) doesn't work; don't wait for your users or customers to tell you this.  (See &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2008_02_11-the_waterfalls_not_working_even_a_client_said_so.html"&gt;The Waterfall's Not Working&lt;/a&gt; .)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've recognized that the problem is the bloated process, you have to embrace real change.  Not &amp;quot;process improvement&amp;quot; where you negotiate over the details of how best to post revised project plans, but &amp;quot;process replacement&amp;quot;.  Rethink things from the fundamentals.  (See &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2008_02_14-why_agile_whats_the_point.html"&gt;Why Agile?&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the most significant thing is to recognize that &lt;strong&gt;LEARNING IS NOT FAILING&lt;/strong&gt;.  When a project is cancelled or change, it may not have failed.  If the project's first few deliverables where really useful and valuable, maybe someone learned that the remaining phases wouldn't be valuable enough.  Canceling the project doesn't mean the project failed to deliver &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt;.  It just failed to deliver the whole boat-load of crap that was initially set out in the project charter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, consider the points from the Computerworld article.  #1 and #5 -- fold the users in -- are pretty clear.  The reason this simple advice is not followed, however, because IT management knows that users change their minds, which changes the scope of the project.  This &amp;quot;learning&amp;quot; behavior leads to change, and change to a project is usually labelled as &amp;quot;failure&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, you can't plan for all the things the users will learn.  Since Big IT labels all change as &amp;quot;scope creep&amp;quot; and treats it as failure, they force the project managers to segregate users from developers.  In essence, a successful project is one in which nothing was learned and there were no midcourse corrections.  The initial estimates (no matter how fanciful) were met on time and on budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="even-savings-are-a-failure"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Even Savings Are A Failure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the users learn that they missed something, scope expands.  No one likes this, so IT prevents it by doing BDUF.  It's stupid, of course, to demand omniscience, but it's a long-standing tradition.  The demand for omniscience is one of the biggest barriers to Agile techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one seems to want to make trade-off decisions.  The Big Design which was done Up Front identified &amp;quot;requirements&amp;quot; and we all know that &amp;quot;required&amp;quot; is absolute, final and non-negotiable.  This is silly.  Few -- if any -- users can unambiguously state what is &amp;quot;required&amp;quot; in the sense of absolute and final.  In reality, all &amp;quot;requirements&amp;quot; fall on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_Method"&gt;MoSCoW&lt;/a&gt;  continuum: Must have, Should have, Can have and Won't have.  In Big IT fantasy land, scope expansion in one area can't be counterbalanced by contraction in another.  It just expands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the users learn that they've asked for something of little or no value, scope should contract.  In most organizations, this is also labeled as Big Old Failure.  Project Managers are accused (accused! blamed!) for padding projects with tasks that eventually got cut.  Program Managers and Directors then start playing the &amp;quot;I'll only give you half of what you asked for because I know you're padding&amp;quot; game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning and change should not be equated with failure.  Changes to scope are normal, expected, and hoped-for consequences of software development.  However, Big IT punishes change.   Aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="foundations"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Foundations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best advice in the article are items #2, #3 and #4: small feature sets, powerful tools, frequent releases.  These form part of the technology core that supports the other Agile practices.  Without these foundational elements, the rest of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://agilemanifesto.org/"&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;  can't easily be realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this, I'd add #6: Unit Test everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, they have a Domain Name (pretend it's www.smallnfp.org). They have an associated organization which is hosting their web site.  Let's call them the Associated Org (www.assocd.org)  The site is big and complex with numerous sophisticated features.  Sadly, they're web 1.0 features, and are starting to show their age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only... there are issues.  The Associated Org has at least two Domain Names pointed at their server.  The Associated Org are nice folks, but not web developers.  Their IIS configuration can only handle minimal distinction between the domain names; one significant consequence is that the web pages can't have a meaningful &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tags in the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.  Really.  It says &amp;quot;Default Page&amp;quot;, and that can't easily be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll call this application server -- with it's current set of problems -- the legacy web presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="web-1-0"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web 1.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue is the Web 1.0 approach:  Provide a site where people can contribute.  &amp;quot;Interactivity&amp;quot; was the feature they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that we're trying to target victims (and family and caregivers) of trauma.  We can't simply create a free-for-all wiki-wiki.  The postings must be moderated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, our legacy web application is a rather complex application:  it has a posting workflow.  Everything has to be approved by a moderator.  The problem is that there are two web sites, a number of status settings, and things can easily vanish.  The workflow is too hard to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On conference calls with the Associates it became clear that the the Web 1.0 site wasn't working well.  It wasn't so much the bugs (hardly any) but the complexity of the thing.  There were many types of content; it wasn't at all clear where each type of posting showed up on the resulting web site.  It wasn't clear precisely which status codes lead to what behavior for postings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-newsletter"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Newsletter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing says &amp;quot;pre-web&amp;quot; more than a newsletter.  Knowledge sharing is important -- it's a big reason why some small not-for-profits exist -- but news in a monthly bundle is a hold-over from print media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bastard child of print media and Web 1.0 is the PDF newsletter.  It can be flashy and eye-catching.  But it's multiple pages; I have to download it and open it to read it.  Bleah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Web 1.1 compromise is the PDF newsletter with an email that summarizes the articles.  A little better -- I can judge if anything is interesting enough to justify downloading it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Web 1.2 compromise is an email that summarizes the articles with links to the full articles and no PDF newsletter.  Better still, because follow-up is easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-do-we-need"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Do We Need?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Small NFP has a number of distinct audiences.  The actual users of the services (in this case, victims of certain kinds of trauma); these are people who -- for various reasons -- may not seek help or may be suspicious of offers of help.  There are the family and friends of a victim; people who might be able to steer the victim to seek help.  There are caregivers who need help and support.  There is the wider circle of associated organizations, non-governmental and even in the government.  Finally, there are potential sources of donations and grant money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a number of channels of communication:  email, print, a &amp;quot;web presence&amp;quot;.  But what is this &amp;quot;web presence&amp;quot;?  The (nearly) static content at www.smallnfp.com?  Or something more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a number of messages.  For each audience we have a distinct message.  Victims, families, caregivers, associated organizations and funding agencies all want to know different things.  There is some overlap, but there are also some distinctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-web-2-0-newsletter-is-a-blog"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Web 2.0 Newsletter Is a Blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let's dispose with the newsletter.  A newsletter isn't very targeted. (Indeed, a big question is &amp;quot;who's on the current email and print mailing lists?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;what message &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;  they be getting?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;how can one document serve all those distinct needs?&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A newsletter is a compendium of individual stories.  Each story has a byline, a dateline, and sometimes other information about the story.  A newsletter saves the stories until it fills enough pages to justify the cost of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Blog is a compendium of individual stories.  The information about the story (byline, dateline, etc.) is still present.  However, the cost of publication is nearly zero (compared with the cost of gathering information, writing and editing), so stories can published when they're still newsworthy.  The cost of publication and the bundling of stories ceases to be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email notification can be sent with each story.  Additionally, there are syndication tools like RSS and ATOM that make email notification a little slow and old-fashioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a print newsletter can bundle a recent batch of stories for publication to folks who don't use computers much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="web-2-0-interactivity-is-more-blogs"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web 2.0 Interactivity Is More Blogs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One stumbling point in the current architecture is the &amp;quot;interactivity&amp;quot; wish.  It would be great to have victims (or families or caregivers) share their stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be great.  Indeed, they probably are sharing their stories.  We know they're not posting on www.smallnfp.org's site.  What's left is that they're probably posting on their own blogs, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.myspace.com"&gt;myspace&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a class="reference external" href="pages.google.com"&gt;google&lt;/a&gt;  or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://geocities.yahoo.com"&gt;geocities&lt;/a&gt;  sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Web 1.0 world, no one could publish anything because publishing was still hard.  It required servers and programmers and knowledge of HTML, ASP and what-not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Web 2.0 world, everyone can publish everything because publishing is free.  Much of it is supported by advertisers.  The rest is supported by very simple, easy-to-use services like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mac.com"&gt;www.mac.com&lt;/a&gt; , or the pay versions of geocities or google pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="email-and-spamming"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Email and Spamming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the Small NFP's email list is split among several servers: the Associated Org's server, a Gmail account and an AOL account.  Any basic web mail account can keep a master list of contacts and appropriate groups within that master list.   There are a large number of web-based mail processing applications.  See the Wikipedia list of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_webmail_providers"&gt;webmail providers&lt;/a&gt; .  Google mail and Yahoo! mail are popular web email solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a mail list is generally for distribution of reminders for web site or blog changes.  The RSS and ATOM syndication protocols (used directly by FireFox and Safari browsers) mean that email isn't required for change notification.  The Web Page and Blog tools provide the necessary feeds, mostly automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, mail lists are endlessly being partitioned based on interest, focus, background, status, geography, demographics, etc.  The problem is that web-based contact management solutions (e.g., &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.salesforce.com"&gt;salesforce.com&lt;/a&gt;  or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.clpsuite.com/"&gt;CLP Suite&lt;/a&gt; ) are rather complex.  Also, it seems odd to use for-profit contact management for a not-for-profit organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two approaches: a simple mail list or a full-up CRM solution.  The fees for single-user CRM solutions are quite low.  Using a full CRM solution is probably the best way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small Not-For-Profit Web Strategy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a way to structure the web presence of a small not-for-profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Site&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Get a Yahoo! Geocities or Google Pages site.  Pay the fees to suppress advertisements and get enough email addresses to handle the current staff.  Use this for your basic contact information, mission statement, strategy, funding sources, and other relatively static information.  This isn't the easiest way to manage information.  However, it's essential to show that the organization is permanent, and serious.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Google Accounts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Everyone should be using &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mail.google.com"&gt;Google Mail&lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docs.google.com"&gt;Google Documents&lt;/a&gt; .  Stop emailing documents among the principals in the organization.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start a blog&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;The Wikipedia entry on Weblog software has a section on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weblog_software#Developer-hosted"&gt;developer-hosted blogs&lt;/a&gt; .  These are all candidate pieces of easy-to-use blogging software.  Generally, you'll keep your blog and site separate.  You will have your blog reference your site and your site reference your blog.  Careful choice of names creates a single identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.blogger.com"&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;  is a Google product, but it isn't part of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pages.google.com"&gt;Google Pages&lt;/a&gt; .  You could use any of the more popular blog tools like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.livejournal.com/"&gt;LiveJournal&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.typepad.com/"&gt;TypePad&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://360.yahoo.com/"&gt;Yahoo 360&lt;/a&gt;  or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wordpress.org/"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;The hardest part of this is changing the current newsletter production cycle to get rid of the once-each-month schedule.  Instead, the newsletter becomes a continuous operation, with each new article turning into a blog posting.  The traditional print newsletter -- as summary of the Blog -- can still be issued, but the writing and editing is spread throughout the month, not jammed into a hectic rush with a deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start a Calendar&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The current web site offers an event list.  This can be replaced with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/calendar"&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/a&gt;  or`30 Boxes. &amp;lt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://30boxes.com/welcome.php"&gt;http://30boxes.com/welcome.php&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;`_   Again, this calendar must link to the primary web site, and the primary web site must link to the calendar.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start a Group or Two&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;A few constituencies should have some additional features -- often provided by tools like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://groups.yahoo.com"&gt;Yahoo! Groups&lt;/a&gt;  or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com"&gt;Google Groups&lt;/a&gt; .  These tools keep web pages, calendars, documents, discussion forums and email lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Generally, a narrow audience (e.g., the trustees) can all be members of a Google Group that provides meeting schedules, agendas, and shared documents.   In some cases, there are audiences with frequent, less-formal contacts.  A group can work well for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick a CRM Tool&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Move all of the existing mailing lists into the CRM tool.  Identify each individual with enough characteristics to permit meaningful communication.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the Small NFP has the relevant capabilities of their current web site.  Each component is easier to use and more sophisticated than in the legacy web site.  The parts (site, blog, calendar) are spread around, but each is focused on one part of the problem.  Using a single set of names, colors and mutual links means that this amalgamation appears reasonably consistent to visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current administrative procedures will change.  Rather than interacting with multiple pages of the (hard-to-use) legacy site, the administrator will interact with multiple pages of multiple (easier-to-use) sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, there will be several alternatives for communication -- the central calendar, a web page change, a blog posting or a group calendar entry that's only visible to the relevant group.   This requires some care to pick the best and most appropriate place to put the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a MySpace Page&lt;/strong&gt;.  MySpace has Blog, Calendar and Address Book capabilities.  However, each feature is relatively primitive.  Further MySpace is just one way to attract and retain some (but not all) members of the various target audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conversion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conversion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how the Small NFP can move from their legacy web site to a Web 2.0 presence.  This is a multi-step operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, get the existing content into easy-to-use files.  This will require working with the Associated organization that is currently providing web services.  The extracted content could come in a number of forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, post this content to the new blog and web pages.  Some blog tools have automated interfaces that make it possible to move large numbers of files with relatively little manual intervention.  A couple of quick Python programs can probably bulk load the blog postings and calendar events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, direct the existing domain name to the new primary web site.   This finishes any relationship with the Associated organization, simplifying their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, drop all email accounts except the approved GMail accounts.  Stop using AOL.  Send email messages from all the legacy accounts announcing the new accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifth, merge all working email addresses into the chosen CRM solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announce the changes via blog postings, MySpace and email notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NC:  &amp;quot;I can't use Yahoo! mail&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NC: &amp;quot;Yahoo! mail has a &amp;quot;Home&amp;quot; tab which isn't the inbox.  It always lands there.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;Yep.  That's a javascript thing.  The tab isn't bookmarkable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NC:  &amp;quot;The fact that I can't land directly on the &amp;quot;Inbox&amp;quot; tab makes Yahoo! mail unacceptable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--Omitted:  a long &amp;quot;can you explain why&amp;quot; digression that's frankly a strange thing.--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;Well, use Google Mail then.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NC:  &amp;quot;Can't do that either -- I've used the Yahoo! mail for so long that I can't change.  My only choice is to configure the POP reader in Yahoo!, but that's the Yahoo! plus and I don't want to pay for mail service.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay.  So no technology is acceptable here.  I'm stumped as to what to do.  Can't use Yahoo!  Must use Yahoo!.  This is going nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NC:  &amp;quot;I want to consolidate my iTunes libraries.  I opened the iTunes library folder on my office computer, dragged all the files into a CD and then dragged them into the iTunes library folder on my home computer, but now my library is all screwed up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;Here's a hint: don't do that.  Use the iTunes import function.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NC:  &amp;quot;That's too slow.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;Dragging didn't work, so slow is your only choice.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NC:  &amp;quot;There has to be another way.  This is really popular software, there has to be something 'out there' that manages the iTunes library for you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;There is.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NC:  &amp;quot;Really?  What?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;iTunes.  Just use it like it's supposed to be used.  Don't work around it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NC:  &amp;quot;I can't.  It's too slow.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;Then use something else.  By a Zune and use whatever Microsoft offers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NC:  &amp;quot;I already have an iPod, so I have to use iTunes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you must use iTunes and you can't use iTunes.  Okay.  This is going nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-prototype"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Prototype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I fielded some calls on building a prototype of an application.  But nothing was acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that prototypes are fun, I do a lot of them.  I use Django.  Why?  I can piece together a quick data model and just slap together page after page of views that actually work.  In many cases, the &amp;quot;update&amp;quot; use cases are so poorly defined that the default admin pages are fine.  The rest of the user experience is easy to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Django encourages learning.  Evolve the data model, rebuild the test cases and views, and you're up and running right away.  Sometimes with the customer sitting there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, however, the application was much, much more complex.  It had a stand-alone desktop component that used mostly web service requests.  It had a central web site, but that had  a small user interface.  The desktop applications had to work stand-alone with intermittent synchronization back to the central database.  Remote mobile computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every prototype proposal was unacceptable.  But we still had to create a prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="who-and-why"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who and Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They wanted a free prototype.  We can't really do that, since this isn't a &amp;quot;product line&amp;quot; that we're offering.  It's custom software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They weren't happy buying a prototype, so they threw out the following option: &amp;quot;A Scalable Prototype&amp;quot;.  This made very little sense to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First -- and foremost -- I asked &amp;quot;Who's the decision-maker&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;How does a prototype help them make a decision?  What will they see in a prototype?&amp;quot;  The answer was uselessly vague -- the decision-maker is the funding organization (duh! that's more-or-less a matter of definition).  The decision is &amp;quot;they want to see a prototype, it will help secure funding.&amp;quot;  That's not a very clear answer to &amp;quot;what do you need to know.&amp;quot;  That's just a recapitulation of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, they don't know what decision is being made.  They won't tell us who is making it.  But they have directed us to write a proposal for a &amp;quot;Scalable Prototype&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="scalable-in-what-dimension"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scalable in What Dimension?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said the word &amp;quot;scalable&amp;quot;.  It's an application with a desktop component and a server component.  What's scalable?  The volume of data on the desktop?  The volume of data required to synchronize desktop and server?  The number of clients the server can handle?  The total number of users?  What are we trying to scale?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Scalable&amp;quot; doesn't mean scalable.  It means &amp;quot;extensible&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;evolvable&amp;quot;.  They want us to do &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_prototyping#Evolutionary_prototyping"&gt;Evolutionary Prototyping&lt;/a&gt; .  Okay, I think I get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They want a prototype that's free; something we don't do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With limited input from them, we're supposed to build &amp;quot;something&amp;quot; which will evolve into a complete product.  We don't have any use cases or other analysis material.  That's part of a future contract that we'll win by doing a prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we're have a Non-Compromise conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NC:  &amp;quot;It can't be a throwaway prototype&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;Fine.  What does it need to show?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NC:  &amp;quot;Something to demonstrate the concepts so we can get funding.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;There are many concepts.  Do they want to see the database synchronization?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NC:  &amp;quot;No.  Too technical.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;Do they want to see the server side in any way.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NC:  &amp;quot;No.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;Do they want to see the desktop application -- the thing we don't have specified.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NC:  &amp;quot;Not really.  Just the concept.  But in a form we can build on.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;You mean the desktop application framework.  That's what we build on.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NC:  &amp;quot;No, not the framework, the concept.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;So, screen shots of the desktop?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NC:  &amp;quot;Screen &lt;em&gt;concepts&lt;/em&gt; .&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;Sketches?  Wireframes?  The actual application?  Remember, we don't have any use cases, so actual is a little crazy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NC:  &amp;quot;Not sketches.  Not real screens.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;Do you mean mockups.  In Visio.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NC:  &amp;quot;Not mockups.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it's not sketches, not mockups and not real screens.  I can't find any gaps along this spectrum to figure out what they're asking for.  It isn't a non-technical sketch; it isn't a semi-technical mock-up; it isn't a fully-realized SWING Frame.  What is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever they want, it's none of the things I've mentioned.  And compromise is right out of the picture.  It's either the thing they want or the project -- prototype and all -- is cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks like …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The requirements are a sequence diagram showing a complex back-and-forth with the vendor's web service.  Each request and reply is detailed, but there's no overview or summary stated.  It's implied, and all of the business folks can articulate it, but no one wrote any of it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks like a relatively clean, RESTful kind of service -- our customers send us requests, we gather information from vendors, do our value-add processing, and send a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like the classic Web Services Proxy design pattern.  We define a nice Python class that's a proxy for the external services (and their goofy protocols).  We can then define a simple WSGI application to use those services and do our value-add processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
class SomeService( object ):
    def someMethod( self, **args ):
        Create XML request object
        Create Request with a method of POST
        urllib2.open( )
        Parse XML response
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
class OurApplication( object ):
    def __init__( self, service ):
        self.service= service
    def __call__( environ, start_response ):
        request= simplejson.load( wsgi.input )
        self.service.someMethod( ... )
        self.service anotherMethod( ... )
        self.service.step3(...)
        self.service.moreAndMore(...)
        self.ourValueAddProcessing( ... )
        start_response( '200 OK', [('Content-type','application/json')]
        return [ simplejson.dumps( reply ) ]
    def ourValueAddProcessing( self, **kw ):
         some processing that we're going to charge for
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the project plan is to debug the service proxy and write the application.  Using Python and the widely available WSGI tools, this isn't a lot of programming.  We should be up and running inside of a month.  Right?  Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="focus-on-value"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Focus on Value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone's focus was on the &amp;quot;rocket science&amp;quot; part of this: using an external vendor for information.  This is where the business owners had spent a lot of time.  The value add was so obvious, it didn't need to be written down.  But the negotiations with the vendors -- the service level agreements, the contracts, the terms and conditions, the commercial considerations -- had soaked up a lot of brain calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a long list of vendor contacts.  I had examples, documents, URL's, all kinds of supporting material for the vendor data gathering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for our &amp;quot;value add&amp;quot;, I had nothing.  I had bupkes.  It was a &amp;quot;calculation&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;lookup&amp;quot; or something.  I didn't even have the name of the internal folks who knew this.  I had a spreadsheet, and it wasn't consistent enough to make sense of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="invertability"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Invertability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some digging, the question arose as to what the essential processing scenario should be.  It sure looks like the main processing has the following outline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some internal value-add steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather Vendor data (a long back-and-forth)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A final internal value-add step to combine everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which view is right?  The Vendor-centric sequence?  A sequence focused on our value-add?  More importantly, how can we make it irrelevant?  The answer is an &amp;quot;invertable&amp;quot; design.  Each step is a separate object, the overall service merely combines the various steps in some useful order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-command-design-pattern"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Command Design Pattern&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works out well if each step follows the GoF &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern"&gt;Command&lt;/a&gt;  design pattern.  A sequence of steps is also a Command; this permits me to reswizzle this with every rise and fall in the slowly-solidifying requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
class Command( object ):
    def __init__( self, service ):
        self.service= service
    def __call__( self, state ):
        return NotImplemented

class OurStep1( Command ):
    def __call__( self, state ):
        state.onething= our value-add

class OurStep2( Command ):
    def __call__( self, state ):
        state.anotherthing= another value-add

class VendorStep1( Command ):
    def __call__( self, state ):
        self.service.someMethod(...)

class VendorStep2( Command ):
    def __call__( self, state ):
        self.service.anotherMethod(...)

class Vendor( Command ):
    def __init__( self, *args ):
        super( Vendor.self).__init__( *args )
        self.vs1= VendorStep1( self.service )
        self.vs2= VendorStep2( self.service )
    def __call__( self, state ):
        for step in ( self.vs1, self.vs2 ):
            step( state )

class OurValueAdd( Command ):
    def __init__( self, *args ):
        super( OurValueAdd, self ).__init__( *args )
        self.our1= OurStep1( self.service )
        self.our2= OurStep2( self.service )
        self.vend= Vendor( self.service )
    def __call__( self, state ):
        for step in ( self.our1, self.vend, self.our2 ):
            step( state )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we can use any of the steps in any order.  And we can recombine them, extend them, replace them, contract them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="all-that-overhead"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All That Overhead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears like we've micro-managed a simple thing.  We took a simple piece of procedural programming, turned each step into an object, and added a lot of overheads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; piece of programming isn't fully defined.  Any one of the &amp;quot;steps&amp;quot; could expand, contract or get replaced.  Our impact is controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's one big change, however, may be pervasive.  Additional service definitions will change the constructor.  We'd have to switch to a dictionary, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;**services&lt;/tt&gt;, and each class would have to pick a specific member in the collection of services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

It seems to me that REST with JSON is a very lightweight approach to implementing web services.  Doing this in Python further trims down the technology stack by limiting the amount of source code and the amount of work required to build something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental design issue for REST is -- as cleanly as possible -- to make your application's resources available through URI's.  In order to do this, you need to understand your resources.  The process looks something like the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From IBM's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-restfulsoa/"&gt;RESTful SOA&lt;/a&gt;  paper, we see a four-step summary of REST design.  This presumes you have some design already completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide on the resources and their descriptive URLs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose a data format for communication on each URL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specify the methods on each resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specify the returned data and status codes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Ben Ramsey's presentation on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://benramsey.com/media/talks/ipcse07-rest.pdf"&gt;RESTful Design&lt;/a&gt; , we have six steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine your resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide what methods each resource will support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link the resources together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop your data schemas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rationalize your schemas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose the best content type/format to represent your schemas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these help, but they seem incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="implementation-details"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implementation Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Django does a lot (ORM, URL mapping, free admin interface) it's my personal jumping-off point for web applications.  Django's essential design principles are RESTful from the beginning.  See the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/url_dispatch/"&gt;URL dispatcher&lt;/a&gt;  documentation.  This references the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI"&gt;Cool URI's Don't Change&lt;/a&gt;  document by Tim Berners-Lee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, Django encourages us to get the model right to begin with, then we can (easily) define RESTful access to that model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the problem.  We have two interfaces: a human interface and a WS API; these are comingled.  Along with multiple interfaces, we've also got several applications that are part of the overall service offering.  With an interface dimension and a application dimension, how do we distinguish among the various URI's?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="enumerating-the-choices"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enumerating The Choices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got the application dimension (also known as subject areas).  For example, there might be separate applications for Customer, Services Catalog, Order Pricing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also got the &amp;quot;interface&amp;quot; dimension: human via HTML vs. WS API via JSON (or XML).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With two independent dimensions we've got the kind of matrix design that gives people gas and makes them invent &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming"&gt;aspect-oriented programming&lt;/a&gt; .  Matrix designs aren't a reason to invent a new paradigm, it just requires a little care with the paradigms we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our URI's are linear -- even though our design isn't -- and we have to group our URI's into tree-like paths.  We can put application first, or interface first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/customer/xml/ID vs /xml/customer/ID&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative, we can also use the HTTP headers to determine the intent behind a request.  It turns out that the HTTP Accept header provides us a handy hint.  We could make our WS API calls fill in a MIME type like &amp;quot;application/json&amp;quot;.  Our human interface would have whatever the browser typically fills in for the Accept header (usually a long string of alternatives starting with &amp;quot;text/xhtml&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-big-push"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Big Push&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/django-rest-interface/"&gt;Django-REST Interface&lt;/a&gt;  package makes the URI-based identification pleasantly simple.  This package makes a lot of design decisions for me.  The process looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define the data schema.  Build it.  Unit test test it.  Use the admin interface to work with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define the access URI's and representations.  These go together.  Human access is usually represented in HTML.  WS API access can be any combination of JSON, XML, YAML or some other serialized object representation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define the WS methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).  The status codes could be defined more elaborately, but Django-REST provides a good implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unit test all of this. Use the Django TestCase -- it provides a nice WS client.  See the Django-REST test cases for examples of how to curry in methods for put and delete methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rework the URI's and data model.  You'll never get it right the first time.  It's often hard to correctly model the business entities.  A lot of what passes for SQL design doesn't properly reflect real-world entities very well.  If you start from classes and implement them in SQL, you'll do a lot better than starting from SQL and trying to map SQL to objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rpc-edge-case"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RPC Edge Case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most notorious edge case is the Remote Procedure Call (RPC); places where there doesn't seem to be a proper resource.  Sometimes, these are thought of in strictly RPC terms -- a POST request with a payload of argument values.  A result is calculated and returned as an appropriate document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I submit that in all cases, the RPC is in reality the creation of that result document.  The result document should -- trivially -- be made into a first-class persistent Django model.  The POST request to &amp;quot;create&amp;quot; the model may provide only a few attributes, the rest are then developed as part of handling the POST.  For all that it matters, they can be implemented in the save() method of the model!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, however, breaks us out of the Django-REST interface.  Our GET requests can still be handled by the Simple or Basic examples.  The POST request, however may break the mold, since the basic POST request isn't a good match for the resulting document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="but-wait"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But Wait&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we have is a POST request that isn't really a good match with the schema object.  Indeed, the point of an RFC-style request is that we have complex transformations (calculations, lookups, etc.) occurring somewhere in the POST processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked closely at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django-rest-interface.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/django_restapi_tests/examples/generic_resource.py"&gt;Generic Resource&lt;/a&gt;  example.  Very closely.  But it wasn't really helping too much, since the inputs were not very close to the final document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after spending hours of reading the Django-REST code, I finally realized what was going on.  Once we're out of the Django-REST sweet spot, we're just doing ordinary Django.  It's just a Django view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special-purpose POST request can be an ordinary Django view.  This can do the elaborate RPC-like calculations.  It can persist the resulting document.  Then it can -- without much difficulty -- use a Django-REST responder to provide the expected HTTP response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the underlying algorithm is shared between a number of closely-related views.  The JSON or XML view works one way.  The HTML view has a slightly different behavior (since it can display error messages to a person), but has the same underlying algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

HTML can represent the same data in a variety of ways, even within a single web site.  What we have are several layers of parsing; layers which must be linked with increasingly simplified intermediate representations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial HTML lexical scanning and parsing gives us the Document Object Model (DOM) objects.  Mostly, these are elements and attributes that uncover the fine-grained structure of the original document.  Sadly, this level of detail is not something we can make direct use of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's where Python is toweringly cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is this: parsing one page all the way to the final spreadsheet will not provide a general solution.  Indeed, it can barely be made to work.  The obvious algorithm for creating the spreadsheet from the HTML doesn't even work for some rows in the table on the first page we examined.  Moving to another page on the same site reveals more and more HTML &amp;quot;errors&amp;quot; and oddities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;HTML Note&lt;/strong&gt;.  Some HTML syntax errors aren't really errors, they're an artifact of the SGML legacy; that doesn't make them any easier to parse.  Worse, the presence of errors is compounded by &lt;strong&gt;Rule One of the Browser&lt;/strong&gt;: All HTML Gets Rendered No Matter How Malformed.  Because of Rule One, HTML can be crap and the QA folks just nod and say &amp;quot;it displays OK&amp;quot;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we've figured out the content of the page, we can extract it, parse it and use it all we want.  In some cases, the data is historical, and one-time parsing as all we need.  In other cases, however, getting a page of HTML is -- currently -- the way some particular web service is implemented.  Some organizations offer some data in HTML only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One solution is to try and use &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/"&gt;Beautiful Soup&lt;/a&gt;  to get past the HTML errors.  While this is helpful, it doesn't get past the irregularities in the way HTML was used by the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-pipeline"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Pipeline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick is to do what compilers do: create a pipeline of intermediate representations.  Stage one is a transformation from HTML to DOM objects (Document, Element and Attribute).  This is (relatively) easy, and any of the available parsers can do this nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm picky, however, and I like to have first-class support for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://exciton.cs.rice.edu/javaresources/DesignPatterns/VisitorPattern.htm"&gt;Visitor&lt;/a&gt;  design pattern.  The built-in Python &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-xml.dom.html"&gt;xml.com&lt;/a&gt;  library doesn't have this.  So, I built my own version of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-xml.dom.minidom.html"&gt;xml.dom.minidom&lt;/a&gt;  with proper Visitor support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one additional feature: a nice __repr__ that will serialize the entire Document as a proper Python expression.   You wind up with a file that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
Element( 'body', {'alink': '#000080', 'text': '#000000', 'bgcolor': '#FFFFFF', 'link': '#0080C0', 'background': 'sitebck7.gif', 'vlink': '#808080'}, *[Text( '\r\n\r\n' )
, Element( 'ul', {}, *[Text( '\r\n' )
, Element( 'ul', {}, *[Text( '\r\n' )
, Element( 'ul', {}, *[Text( '\r\n' )
, Element( 'ul', {}, *[Text( '\r\n' )
, Element( 'center', {}, *[Element( 'p', {}, *[Element( 'img', {'src': 'top2sml.gif', 'alt': '...some text...', 'width': '406', 'height': '77'}, *[] )
] )
] )
, Text( '\r\n\r\n' )
, Element( 'center', {}, *[Element( 'p', {}, *[Element( 'b', {}, *[Element( 'font', {'color': '#000052', 'size': '3', 'face': 'Arial'}, *[Text( 'SOME TITLE' )
, Element( 'br', {}, *[] )
etc.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While bulky, this is a lot easier to work with than the output from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-pickle.html"&gt;pickle&lt;/a&gt; .  And it's first-class Python, allowing us to explore with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Scalability Note&lt;/strong&gt;.  There are limitations to this.  Truly huge expressions will break the Python parser.  Your mileage may vary.  You may need to break giant documents into logical pieces and assemble the pieces. You may have something like p1= ...; p2= ...; p &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = ...; doc = [ p1, p2, ..., p &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;  ] to manage bigness.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we've explored, we can write our stage two parser which actually works reliably and handles all of the special cases properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="stage-two"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage Two&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second stage of the pipeline can work from Python source.  Rather than write more parsing and loading functions, stage two starts with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
dom1= eval( file(&amp;quot;stage1.out&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;r&amp;quot;).read() )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, we've deserialized the output from stage 1 with a simple call to eval().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, this is very, very handy for &amp;quot;exploring&amp;quot; the data structure.  We can also import the structure into interactive Python and play around with it at the command prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stage can focus on filtering and building up the next representation, one that is less like a document and more like objects in the problem domain.  We have to be a little cautious how we create those problem domain objects, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The domain model is the thing we wanted in the first place.  The two-stage parser was how we could get to this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="dimensional-model"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dimensional Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the problem domain objects are (usually) pretty obvious from the organization of the content in the HTML pages, the issue is to avoid naively assembling objects without thinking about the organization of the inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, the web content we're parsing is a dimensional (or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_schema"&gt;star schema&lt;/a&gt; ) view of the data.  You'll be building several kinds of objects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dimensional Entities&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Dimensional entities are the &amp;quot;descriptions&amp;quot; of each dimension.  Dimensions include the obvious time and space (geography), but can also include demographic groupings, economic groups (SIC codes), etc.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Facts are measures (with units) that can be categorized  by the dimensions to which they belong.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look at displayed information, you'll often see titles or headings that define specific dimensional entities.  &amp;quot;Northeast Region&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;January 2006&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Hourly Employees&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Retail&amp;quot;, and the like are examples of dimensional entities.  These are objects in one of the (many) dimension classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each measurable fact object will be associated with one or more dimensional objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage two builds the dimensional model objects from the DOM objects.  (The DOM objects were built from HTML.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="stage-three"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage Three&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final bit of processing is to unify the HTML pages into a single star-schema model for analysis and reporting.  Generally, the Stage 2 outputs will be a bunch of collections.  Most of the collections will be dimension definitions, the remaining collection is a sequence of facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each dimension is collected into a mapping from the unique identifier for a dimension entity to the other attributes we know about the entity.  For instance, &amp;quot;January 2006&amp;quot; might be the identifier, but we know several other attributes of this entity:  the year is 2006, the month is January, it's in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facts are a simple sequence (list or tuple) of measures with references to the dimension entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's appealing to simply serialize the fact table with __repr__.  This isn't the best approach, however.  Generally, a large number of facts will have references to a common dimension value.  If we simply serialize the facts with something like the following, we'll have a lot of redundancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
def __repr__( self ):
        return &amp;quot;Fact( %r, %r, %r, %f, %d)&amp;quot; % (
            self.dim1, self.dim2, self.dim3, self.measure1, self.measure2 )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's slightly smoother to provide just the unique object ID's for each dimensional entity, and rebuild the required structure at eval time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our facts are represented in the stage three input as follows.  Rather than include the entire dimension object, we include a dictionary lookup to locate a reference to the dimension entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
time = { 'January 2006': Time( &amp;quot;January 2006&amp;quot;, 2006, 1, 1 ), ... }
space = { 'Northeast': Geography( &amp;quot;Northeast&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;US&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;EN&amp;quot; ), ... }
demo = { 'Full-Time': Demographic(&amp;quot;Full-Time&amp;quot;), ... }
facts = [
    Fact( time['January 2006'], space['Northeast'], demo['Full-Time'], 3.14, 42 ),
    ...
    ]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These files are quite easy to unify.  We can import each file and merge the dimensions to develop the complete set of entities in each dimension.  Once the dimensions are unified, we can do a simple append of all the facts.  This model can be used to write reports or populate a datamart or whatever our goal was when we started down this road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real power comes from using the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index"&gt;Inverted Index&lt;/a&gt;  technique of having each dimension entity reference the set of facts associated with that entity.  This is done by having the __init__ of a Fact register itself with the various dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
class Fact( object ):
    def __init__( self, time, space, demo, m1, m2 ):
        self.time= time
        self.time.addFact( self )
        etc.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staging Our Analysis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 1 transforms HTML to a Python model of the document. This is very, very cool, and supports easy exploration of the Python version of the document to find algorithms for parsing the structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 2 transforms the Python document model into a Python dimensional model, emitting a mapping for each dimension and a sequence for the facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 3 merges the dimensional model values into a single datamart that we can then use for analysis.  The resulting datamart is the same dimensional model from Stage 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining work is (usually) involves locating all facts with a particular dimension value and producing the expected reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
q1Total= 0
for q in [ t for t in time.values() where t.quarter == 1 ]:
    for f in t.facts:
        q1Total += f.m1
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dimensional model gives us all of the analytical capabilities we might want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part is that each step uses Python notation, making it easy to visualize and easy to experiment with the data looking for the unifying patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

Code would be a lot more compact and easy to read if exceptions were used.
Request favor: Please consider blogging about using exception handling vs &amp;quot;IF o_status = 0&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this juncture, it's not clear what the developer's goal is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix the if o_status = 0 stuff that they're constantly having to look at.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix the organization to improve their programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2a.  Help them use exceptions instead of badly nested if-statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2b.  Help them ditch PL/SQL for something faster and simpler.  Example: Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vent about the peer group's shoddy programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's why the goal is confusing.  The email goes on to include a reference to Chapter 7 of the PL/SQL User's Guide and Reference, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://download-east.oracle.com/docs/cd/B10501_01/appdev.920/a96624/07_errs.htm#8858"&gt;Handling PL/SQL Errors&lt;/a&gt; .  Since the information is already in the email, what more can I offer?  Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the email ended with the following: &amp;quot;However, it would be nice to have a discussion of &amp;quot;IF status = 0&amp;quot; vs exception handling discussed from an architectural perspective. After all Java has exception handling.&amp;quot;  What?  From an architectural perspective, PL/SQL is a fundamental mistake.  It spreads application software around between application servers and the database server.  Yuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's pretend we're aiming at &amp;quot;fixing&amp;quot; the organization minimally -- just get them to use exceptions.  The &amp;quot;architectural perspective&amp;quot; is ridiculous, since PL/SQL creates more problems than it solves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-argument"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Argument&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you make it a condition of employment, programmers have a number of reasons for NOT changing from many if-statements to exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's &amp;quot;costly&amp;quot; to change.  The &amp;quot;disruption&amp;quot; adversely impacts quality or productivity or something.  [I put the terms in quotes because -- if you ask -- there's no detail supporting the disruption claim.  Mostly, it's all code for &amp;quot;I don't want to learn something new right now.&amp;quot;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exceptions are confusing.  They force you to scroll down to read the exception block, which is bad.  Endless if-statements mean that the error handling is adjacent to the relevant statement.  And using nested blocks to wrap each statement with exception handling adjacent is &amp;quot;too much syntax.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exceptions are slow/memory intensive/bad in some other way.  [This is, of course, anecdotal; there's never any actual benchmark.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exceptions don't capture some nuance of the algorithm.  [Clearly, the if-statements aren't working either -- or we wouldn't have this email in the first place!]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can our developer do in the face of these kinds of stonewalling arguments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="techniques-that-don-t-work"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Techniques That Don't Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technique one: provide the PL/SQL reference manual pages.  They did that.  Apparently, that just fueled the argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technique two: Appeal to Authority.  For example, referencing a blog posting.  This will lead people to do nothing.  Odds are good that no one will read a blog in the first place.  A blog posting is exactly as valuable as the Oracle PL/SQL User's Guide pages -- pages already provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does a blog posting change things?  Generally, it makes the argument shift slightly to include the blog author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a blog posting, the programmers will add point #5 to their argument against exceptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That blogger didn't get the nuances of our culture/experience/application domain/technology stack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technique Three: how about a few False Dichotomies?  Make up some all or nothing situation where if-statements after the SQL statement are bad.  How about &amp;quot;You're not using all features of the language.  Therefore, you shouldn't use the language?&amp;quot;  Use all of the PL/SQL features or drop the language and switch to Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good advice.  Wrong &amp;quot;reason&amp;quot;.  (If you can call a false dichotomy a reason.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing information (manual pages, blog postings, etc.) doesn't work.  Okay they're informed.  They still have 5 solid reasons for not changing (it's costly, it's confusing, it performs poorly, it misses some nuance, it doesn't fit our culture/tech stack).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="actually-do-the-work"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Actually Do The Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to act as an agent of change is to &lt;strong&gt;Actually Change Something&lt;/strong&gt;.  Not talk about change possibilities or inform people of better courses of action, but actually do something.  If you're constantly having to look at some crap code, you must be doing maintenance or enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're reading the code with intent to change, think about the long-term cost of having the next maintainer (or enhancer) read that code.  Save everyone a lot of money by doing two things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reverse Engineer some Unit Tests for this offensive piece of code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactor the Module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh,&amp;quot; people say, &amp;quot;that's too costly.&amp;quot; [Really?  Is it also confusing, performs poorly, misses some nuance and doesn't fit your culture?  If so, you're just as much part of the problem as your peers who won't change.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can't,&amp;quot; people say, &amp;quot;I'm not authorized to rewrite it.&amp;quot;  Got it.  You want change without actual sweaty labor.  Excellent.  Change without any work is about 4lbs of pixie dust at $1,000 per gram.  That'll change everyone without any work on your part.  And it'll buy me a Bentley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It's not 'politically correct' around here to make waves like that.&amp;quot;  Okay.  I won't make waves.  I won't do anything, either.  Clearly, your job is not to add value by improving the enterprise's software asset.  Since you're not doing something so obviously valuable, you must be doing something more valuable.  Keep doing whatever it is that's more valuable than reducing the cost of the legacy code and quit complaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[BTW, the 'we don't have time to fix legacy problems' is a false economy, but every IT manager I've ever met has said it emphatically.  I've been asked to scope and plan the replacement of 20- and 30-year old COBOL applications that are breaking the back of the organization.  The plans were, of course, shelved because reducing costs &amp;quot;doesn't create enough value for our end-users.&amp;quot;  Got it, the customer insists that limping along with 60% of the organization supporting old crap &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt;  create value.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="suggestion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suggestion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually Do Something.  Just fix the code.  &amp;quot;How will I know it works?&amp;quot; you ask.  That's why step one was to create unit tests.  Step two is to refactor the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read Larry O'Brien's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sdtimes.com/content/article.aspx?ArticleID=32059"&gt;30K + 100K = success or failure?&lt;/a&gt;  column.  Unit testing works.  And people complain about it.  [Example Complaint: &amp;quot; time spent writing a test function is time that could be used on application code&amp;quot; -- what?  That's insane because you can't distinguish between application and test: test is essential to making the application &amp;quot;work&amp;quot;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.dzone.com/links/testdriven_development_and_software_quality.html"&gt;Test-Driven Development and Software Quality&lt;/a&gt;  in DZone (amongst other places.)  The point is that unit testing allows you to simplify.  Applications with unit tests are measurably simpler.  In this case, the exception handling folderol is a punishing kind of cycolmatic complexity that is reduced (but not eliminated) through exception handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So:  Develop unit tests.  Refactor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, brag about the success to your peers.  Carping, complaining and nagging don't work.  Leading by example might work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Go deh! has a deep analysis of in &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paddy3118.blogspot.com/2008/05/duck-typing-done-right-is-wrong.html"&gt;Duck Typing Done Right is Wrong&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;.  It took a minute to parse, but the article is excellent.   (A less obscure title would quote the original posting properly: '&amp;quot;Duck Typing Done Right&amp;quot; is Wrong', but that's less catchy).  The original &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/duck_typing_done_right"&gt;Duck Typing Done Right&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot; plays the paranoia card: you can't trust &amp;quot;them&amp;quot; to understand your semantics without resorting to some kind of &amp;quot;context-free&amp;quot; reference, implicitly backed with a complete ontology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a great new variation on the &amp;quot;defensive programming&amp;quot; position:  you can't trust anyone to follow your API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This -- it turns out -- has nothing to do with API's, duck typing or dynamic languages.  This is a much, much simpler problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="defensive-programming"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defensive Programming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years back, I was trying to read some Java code that included two things that are generally a waste of time and money.  First was endless declarations of things that were private.  Second was batches of if-statements that effectively confirmed that internally referenced methods passed the right arguments back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have much use for Java private in in-house IT projects.  If you're not selling the .class files, private isn't helping.  I asked what it was about; who are we keeping it private from?  The programmer told me, with a straight face, that he was worried about &amp;quot;someone&amp;quot; using the classes improperly -- calling the methods wrong, bypassing the public interfaces, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who?&amp;quot; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You know&amp;quot;, he replied, &amp;quot;another programmer who didn't really 'get' the class API's.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="who-specifically"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who, Specifically?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was alarmed at this weird paranoia.  First, it's in-house IT -- if you can't trust the folks in the next rack of cubes, who can you trust?  Second, it's a one-person project -- no one else was going to see the code in the foreseeable future.  Indeed, most in-house IT is maintained by the author and when the author leaves the code is replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to sit through the author's long story about an interface (written in PL/SQL, not Java) where an incoming file had the wrong format.  What?  What does that have to do with anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the programmer in question, it proved that &amp;quot;defensive programming&amp;quot; was essential to success.  To make this point, however, the programmer had to conflate &amp;quot;bad interface implementation&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;I can't trust myself to remember my own API&amp;quot;.  Which sounds schizophrenic to me; private wasn't likely to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked, &amp;quot;Who Specifically?&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Who, specifically, will abuse the API?&amp;quot;  The answer was the vague, hand-wringing &amp;quot;other programmers&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/duck_typing_done_right"&gt;Duck Typing done right&lt;/a&gt; , there's the paranoid expression &amp;quot;Extend the context somewhat&amp;quot;.  As if someone, somewhere can't be trusted.  Who specifically, can't be trusted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="asking-for-names"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Asking for Names&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask for names in these cases.  If we can find the programmer who's likely to subvert the API, or mis-implement the interface, we can ask them to do quality assurance on the API or interface specification.  It isn't hard to get them to buy in on the design.  And if they don't buy in, it's easy to get specific objections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To subvert my approach toward clarity, people will raise up the &amp;quot;What about 'future' programmers?&amp;quot; question.  I'm baffled.  I ask, &amp;quot;Who, the ones who haven't been hired yet?&amp;quot;  What about the post-apocalyptic half-mutant flesh-eating apes?  Are they included in the 'future' programmers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is this: I can't see the value in hand-wring about &amp;quot;others&amp;quot; or some &amp;quot;extended context&amp;quot;.  I think it's essential identify these &amp;quot;others&amp;quot; or this &amp;quot;foreign code&amp;quot; which will break our design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we don't have a specific list of &amp;quot;others&amp;quot; or specific &amp;quot;foreign code&amp;quot;, then... uh... we don't actually have a problem.  We have a potential problem.  A potential problem with a microscopic risk of occurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="real-problems"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Real Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While real problems can arise from programming changes, we have better techniques than an external ontology or lots of bogus defensive programming parameter-checking.  We have ordinary API documentation and ordinary unittest cases.  This is simple quality assurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paddy3118.blogspot.com/2008/05/duck-typing-done-right-is-wrong.html"&gt;Duck Typing Done Right is Wrong!&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot; states, the ontology doesn't help.  A context-free name isn't understanding, it's just a name.  If you don't understand the meaning or intent behind a class structure,  names aren't really the root cause of the confusion; usually there are three root causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoddy API documentation&lt;/strong&gt;.  My policy is this: try to explain it to a manager, or Quentin the rabbit who lives in the back yard.  (They have the same attention span.)  If you can't get a pithy, tidy, no-diagrams explanation, you've got work to do.  Refactor and rewrite the doco until you can explain it without pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An unwillingness to understand what's really going on in the API&lt;/strong&gt;.   Some programmers don't read well, and start off assuming things about the API; their reading reduces to looking for confirmation of their assumptions.  When they don't find the hoped-for confirmation they may proceed anyway (with lots of EPIC FAIL) -- often deadline-obsessed managers will force this situation.  Other times programmers will replace an effort at understanding with a superficial but scholarly-looking analysis of the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When programmers are unwilling to learn, this often surfaces at complaints about &amp;quot;inconsistencies&amp;quot; in the documents.  Sometimes these are simply shoddy documentation.  More often, however, the inconsistency is a conflict between the programmer's assumption and what the documentation actually says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No independent confirmation&lt;/strong&gt;.  No unit test, no audit, nothing.  I can have an ontology that makes claims about my classes.  By without evidence (i.e., unit test cases) that context-free name is just as much a lie as my context-dependent name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="where-duck-typing-could-fail"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where Duck Typing Could Fail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the quote &amp;quot;The main criticism of Duck Typing has been that what is gained in flexibility is lost in precision: it may be good for small projects, but it does not scale&amp;quot;.  Here, the code-word scale stands for &amp;quot;apply well when we introduce 'others'&amp;quot;.  Why doesn't it apply when we introduce &amp;quot;others&amp;quot;?  Because, the &amp;quot;others&amp;quot; don't get the context:  &amp;quot;The context in which the duck typing works is a hidden assumption&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the context for duck typing is not hidden.  I suppose it could be, but you'd have to produce malicious documentation that concealed the purpose of a class with the intent to confuse programmers who want to reuse it.  In the presence of this level of shoddiness, who's going to make an effort to reuse the class in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, there'd have to be no documentation at all.  Which, I find, is standard practice for in-house IT projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh wait, that's why interfaces break, too.  That's why the paranoid schizophrenics feel the need to write useless code to test all inputs of all methods.  There's no documentation; no explicit, written agreement on formats; no unit tests to confirm compliance with the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are the ingredients for the situation in which duck typing doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No documentation of the interface.  Or bad (incorrect, incomplete, misleading) documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No unit test to define conformance with the documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No effort to understand the interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait.  This has nothing whatsoever to do with duck typing.  This is all just ordinary software quality assurance.   These are the ingredients for failure in every kind of software development technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are simple.  Document (an ontology may help, but it doesn't solve the problem); provide proof with unittests (merely compiling means nothing); seek to understand, not confirm (your assumptions are always wrong).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

It shows up in many places.  Most OS's have concurrent processes.  Applications like Apache have concurrent threads within a process for handling web requests.  Oracle not only handles concurrent queries from multiple users, but you can define a table to use parallel physical structures, further promoting concurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got an email asking about Oracle's Partitioned Table structure.  The email used unbound terms like &amp;quot;Good&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Better&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Advantageous&amp;quot;.  This kind of question is unanswerable, making it difficult to be helpful.  Indeed, these questions have a mysticism about them that I can't cope with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First (and foremost) architecture solves problems.  Without a specific, tangible problem, there is no architecture and there is no architectural recommendation.  That's absolute and final.  You can't ask about parallelism in a vacuum with no specific application.  In general, technology -- by itself -- is boring.  If you aren't applying it to a problem, it's just ideas.  The idea of 13 being a non-prime number, for example, is just an idea.  A partitioned table, similarly, is just an idea.  So what?  The question is &amp;quot;What are you trying to accomplish?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, &amp;quot;Better&amp;quot; doesn't have a generic binding.  &amp;quot;Better&amp;quot; is only meaningful in the specific context of a quality dimension to optimize.  Most of the time, &amp;quot;Better&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;Less&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Less Cost&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Less Time&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Less Memory&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Less I/O&amp;quot;.  Sometimes &amp;quot;Better&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;More&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;More Adaptable&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;More Maintainable&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;More Auditable&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;More Secure&amp;quot;, etc.  Lacking any specific optimization criteria, the idea of a partitioned table is fine.  Or too much work.  Or essential to success.  I can't tell from words like &amp;quot;Better&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="answers"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Answers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To focus the conversation, I asked, specifically, which &amp;quot;Less&amp;quot; they were interested in.  &amp;quot;Less Time&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Less Memory&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;Less I/O&amp;quot;.  I specifically said &amp;quot;Pick One&amp;quot;.  Here's the answer I got: &amp;quot;Thanks for explicitly listing them.&amp;quot;.  Seriously.  No answer of any kind.  Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failing that, I tried to lift up the ideas of &amp;quot;empiricism&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;scientific method&amp;quot;:  do some research, form a conjecture, make a prediction, run some experiments.  This is covered nicely in Wikipedia's entry on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"&gt;Scientific Method&lt;/a&gt; , and this article on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/epist.html"&gt;Epistemology&lt;/a&gt; .  Here's the answer I got: &amp;quot;So, I picked an approach. I will take finger to keyboard and see what I get.&amp;quot;.  Seriously.  No theory, no prediction, no comparison, just coding one partitioning approach.  Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that this was someone for whom &amp;quot;Science&amp;quot; doesn't apply; someone for whom mysticism is better than empiricism.  It appears that I can't really help much there.  I don't have a strong enough background in mysticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="concurrency-modeling"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concurrency Modeling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's try empiricism and see if that works.  Here's the simplest possible model -- no communication among the processes.  We'll have &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;  concurrent processes.  Let's keep it simple, and say &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 4.  Let's call the processes a, b, c and d.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to run these four processes.  Trivially expressed by the following two shell scripts, called Serial and Parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Serial.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;a; b; c; d&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Parallel.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;a &amp;amp; b &amp;amp; c &amp;amp; d&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's examine the possible run-times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Serial:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;a.time + b.time + c.time + d.time&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Parallel:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;max( a.time, b.time, c.time, d.time )&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is less?  By definition, parallel must run in less time than serial.  Conclusion?  Parallel always results in less run time.  Unless of course, 3 of the 4 processes are degenerate cases and run in zero time.  Then serial == parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's pretty much all you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want details?  Write four shell scripts which consist of &amp;quot;sleep &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; for different values of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;.  Run the two versions.  Measure the time.  Write a loop to run each version 128 times and average the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did we do?  Theory, Prediction, Experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="context-switching-fetish"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context Switching Fetish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;True Student of OS&lt;/strong&gt; will cry foul at the above analysis.  The Student will claim that Parallel programs somehow involve more overhead than Serial programs because the OS must interleave the executions of multiple processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may have been true -- 20 years ago.  When I was a kid, serial meant the OS was otherwise doing NOTHING.  Parallel meant interleaved concurrent execution -- and concurrency was some kind of special case.  Today, all OS's are doing hundreds of things concurrently even when they're just idling.  The context-switch overheads are essentially fixed.  The only way you can even notice the overheads is to introduce boat-loads of new processes.  Right now, I've got 60 processes running, and I'm just writing.  Running one more process or four more processes is not a measurable change in the number of context switches being managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="equal-sized-workloads"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Equal-Sized Workloads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look Oracle's table partitioning.  This is the same as having different workloads for our &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 4 concurrent processes.  To make it easy on the brain, get a deck of playing cards (or Tarot cards, since we're looking at mysticism of parallelism).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cut the deck into four piles.  Make no effort at equality.  Just cut and allocate into four piles: a, b, c and d.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to simulate Oracle's physical I/O operations, deal batches of 3 cards into the middle of the table.  Pick 3 cards off a, 3 cards off b, 3 cards of c, 3 cards off d.  That's one quantum of time.  Repeat, counting one quanta of time for each 3-card deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're nearly done, some pile will run out of cards.  This parallel partition finished early.  When you're completely done, all piles will be out of cards.  How many quanta of time did it take?  There's a theoretical maximum and minimum.  Work this out before reading further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hint: For Tarot cards the minimum is 20 quanta.  The maximum is 78 quanta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want more details?  Do this a few dozen times, creating a spreadsheet with your results.  From your randomization experiments, get the average, standard deviation, best and worst cases.  These will be clustered around the middle of the theoretical extremes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the best case is about 1/4 of the worst case.  &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 4.  Hmmm.   Pattern?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="unequal-workloads"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unequal Workloads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's were the fetish kicks into high gear.  If equal workloads leads to minimal time, what's the impact of unequal workloads?  How much fetishizing can we do to keep the workloads equal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a great version of that question: &amp;quot;Oracle partitions are balanced when they have approximately the same number of rows. For the sake of argument lets quantify &amp;quot;approximately&amp;quot; as plus/minus 3 percent.&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three&lt;/em&gt;  percent.  Question: Where did this number come from?  Answer: fetishizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's think.  Time depends on physical I/O's.  So, we really care about blocks, not rows.  How may rows per block determines how close &amp;quot;approximately&amp;quot; means.  If the rows are small (e.g., 0.5K bytes) and the blocks big (e.g., 32K bytes), then ±64 rows is still precisely the same-sized partition.  As a percentage, 64 rows could be 100% or nearly 0%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blocks are harder to count than rows.  Indeed, Oracle's use of blocks is quite confusing, so their documentation suggests using number of rows; for large tables it's as misleading as anything else.  For small tables, why are we bothering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-unequal-before-we-notice"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Unequal Before We Notice?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we're back to the business problem, at this point.  We need to know &amp;quot;how fast is fast enough?&amp;quot;  If one partition is too slow, then four partitions, even if radically different in size will be faster.  It will be as fast as the largest partition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do they have to be equal-sized?  &lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt;.  The only requirement is that the largest partition's processing time fit within our time box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we need &amp;quot;optimal&amp;quot; run time?  &lt;strong&gt;No&lt;/strong&gt;.  We need to meet the requirements.  If we can partition equally, that's nice, but hardly worth any brain calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="there-s-no-best"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;There's no &amp;quot;Best&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, but,&amp;quot; some folks say; they want a &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equal-sized partitions will minimize run time.  At the cost of figuring out which combination of keys splits rows equally.  You will add complexity elsewhere to determine how to precisely equalize the partitions.  Ask yourself if the cost-benefits are there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW, you can explore your data without doing too much work.  SELECT COUNT(*), x FROM t GROUP BY x; is all you need to do to locate combinations of keys and their relative partition sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt;  need &amp;quot;minimal&amp;quot;, you only need &amp;quot;good enough to make people happy.&amp;quot;  You can fetishize over endless partitioning keys.  Have fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't have a required query run time, you're just wasting time and money playing Oracle.  You can &amp;quot;put finger to keyboard&amp;quot; if it makes you happy.  Hopefully, you're just doing a few COUNT(*) GROUP BY's to get some answers.  If your employer enjoys it enough, you can squander a lot of time on hand-wringing followed by pointless POC's that show one approach with no theoretical framework to act as a basis for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a required query run time, and you are looking for a partition that meets it, you're solving problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hold-the-phone"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hold The Phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wise reader will say &amp;quot;This isn't that hard; I can just assign a surrogate partition number to each row, and guarantee equality.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep.  It's that simple.  A basic &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;count % n&lt;/tt&gt; will assign a number, &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;span class="formula"&gt;0 ≤ &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , that can be the partition number.  That is the bottom line: searching among natural keys and other attributes is a waste of time and money.  Just compute a partition number at load time and be done with it.  Or you can fetishize about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Common dimensions include time, geography, organization, product and the like.  I'm working with some folks whose facts are a bunch of medical test results, and the dimensions are patient, date, and a facility in which the tests were performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got an email with the following situation: &amp;quot;a client who is processing gigs of incoming fact data each day and they use a host of C/C++, Perl, mainframe and other tools for their incoming fact processing and I've seriously considered pushing Python in their organization.&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are my thoughts on using Python for data warehousing when you've got Gb of data daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="small-dimensions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Small Dimensions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pure Python approach only works when your dimension will comfortably fit into memory -- not a terribly big problem with &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt;  dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, it doesn't work well for those dimensions which are so huge that the dimensional model becomes a snowflake instead of a simple star.  When dealing with a large number of individuals (public utilities, banks, medical management, etc.) the &amp;quot;customer&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;patient&amp;quot;) dimension gets too big to fit into memory.  Special bridge-table techniques must be used.  I don't think Python would be perfect for this, since this involves slogging through a lot of data one record at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Python is considerably faster than PL/SQL.  I don't know how it compares with Perl.  Any programming language will be faster than any SQL procedure, because there's no RDBMS overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all small dimensions.  Load the dimension values from the RDBMS into a dict with a single query.  Read all source data records (ideally from a flat file); conform the dimension, tracking changes; write a result record with the dimension FK information to a flat file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iterate through the dimension dictionary and persist the dimension changes.  The details vary with the Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) rules you're using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conformance algorithm is is essentially the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
row= Dimension(...)
ident= ( row.field, row.field, row.field, ... )
dimension.setdefault( ident, row )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases (like the Django ORM) this is called the get-or-create query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-dimension-bus"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Dimension Bus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For BIG dimensions, I think you still have to implement the &amp;quot;dimension bus&amp;quot; outlined in The Data Warehouse Toolkit.  To do this in Python, you should probably design things to look something like the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any big dimensions, use an external sort-merge utility.  Seriously.  They're way fast for data sets too large to fit into memory.  Use CSV format files and the resulting program is very tidy.   The outline is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, sort the source data file into order by the identifying fields of the big dimension (customer number, patient number, whatever).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, query the big dimension into a data file and sort it into the same order as the source file.  (Using the SQL ORDER BY may be slower than an external sort; only measurements can tell which is faster.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, do a &amp;quot;match merge&amp;quot; to locate the differences between the dimension and the source.  Don't use a utility like diff, it's too slow.  This is a simple key matching between two files.  The match-merge loop looks something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
src= sourceFile.next()
dim= dimensionFile.next()
try:
   while True:
      src_key = ( src['field'], src['field'], ... )
      dim_key= ( dim['field'], dim['field'], ... )
      if src_key &amp;lt; dim_key:
         # missing some dimension values
         update_dimension( src )
         src= sourceFile.next()
      elif dim_key &amp;lt; src_key:
         # extra dimension values
         dim= dimensionFile.next()
      else: # src and dim keys match
         # check non-key attributes for dimension change.
         src= sourceFile.next()
except StopIteration, e:
    # if source is at end-of-file, that's good, we're done.
    # if dim is at end of file, all remaining src rows are dimension updates.
    for src in sourceFile:
        update_dimension( src )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of this pass, you'll accumulate a file of customer dimension adds and changes, which is then persisted into the actual customer dimension in the database.  This pass will also write new source records with the customer FK.  You can also handle demographic or bridge tables at this time, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fact-loading"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fact Loading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in DW loading is dimensional conformance.  With a little cleverness the above processing can all be done in parallel, hogging a lot of CPU time.  To do this in parallel, each conformance algorithm forms part of a large OS-level pipeline.  The source file must be reformatted to leave empty columns for each dimension's FK reference.  Each conformance process reads in the source file and writes out the same format file with one dimension FK filled in.  If all of these conformance algorithms form a simple OS pipe, they all run in parallel.  It looks something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
src2cvs source | conform1 | conform2 | conform3 | load
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end, you use the RDBMS's bulk loader (or write your own in Python, it's easy) to pick the actual fact values and the dimension FK's out of the source records that are fully populated with all dimension FK's and load these into the fact table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written conformance processing in Java (which is faster than Python) and had to give up on SQL-based conformance for large dimensions.  Instead, we did the above flat-file algorithm to merge large dimensions.  The killer isn't the language speed, it's the RDBMS overheads.  Once you're out of the database, things blaze.  Indeed, products like the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.syncsort.com/"&gt;syncsort&lt;/a&gt;  data sort can do portions of the dimension conformance at amazing speeds for large datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hand-wringing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hand Wringing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But,&amp;quot; the hand-wringers say, &amp;quot;aren't you defeating the value of the RDBMS by working outside it?&amp;quot;   The answer is NO.  We're not doing incremental, transactional processing here.  There aren't multiple update transactions in a warehouse.  There are queries and there are bulk loads.  Doing the prep-work for a bulk load outside the database is simply more efficient.  We don't need locks, rollback segments, memory management, threading, concurrency, ACID rules or anything.  We just need to match-merge the large dimension and the incoming facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MCF&lt;/strong&gt;  and &lt;strong&gt;NCF&lt;/strong&gt;.  Minimal/No Use of Collections Framework.  The &lt;strong&gt;MCF&lt;/strong&gt;  defect occurs when someone uses only the Array or Vector classes.  The &lt;strong&gt;NCF&lt;/strong&gt;  defect occurs when someone uses only primitive arrays, often with fixed sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NCF&lt;/strong&gt; defects also occur when someone creates a linked list, but insists on traversing it with the horrifying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
for( int i=0; i != aList.size(); ++i ) {
    SomeClass x= (SomeClass)aList.get(i);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find the above deeply disturbing because of the intentionally incomplete understanding of the linked list structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deprecated Feature&lt;/strong&gt;.  This is a big, big warning.  Anyone who insists on using deprecated features needs to find a new job in which learning is not valued.  Deprecated features must be removed from application programs.  There's no room for the moronic &amp;quot;it isn't actually broken yet.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if you read the Java API Docs, you find nuggets of goodness like the following, in Enumeration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
NOTE: The functionality of this interface is duplicated by the Iterator interface. In addition, Iterator adds an optional remove operation, and has shorter method names. New implementations should consider using Iterator in preference to Enumeration.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems simple enough to me: Enumeration is not something you should use.  Yes, it is used in a few places in the collection framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EIM&lt;/strong&gt;  - &lt;strong&gt;BOD&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;strong&gt;EIM&lt;/strong&gt;  is the Everything In Main defect.  Generally, this is accompanied by the &lt;strong&gt;BOD&lt;/strong&gt; (Bad Object Design) defect.  These are closely related, and both stem from a failure to grasp OO design, and a failure to allocate responsibility through the class structure.  Instead of doing some kind of class responsibility assignments, a massive method was written to do all the work.  Often this method is public static void main( string[] args ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Everything In Main defect occurs depressingly often.  There are several good reasons why &lt;strong&gt;EIM&lt;/strong&gt;  programs are defective.  &lt;em&gt;Adaptability and Reusability&lt;/em&gt;: the public main method is the operating system's interface to our application, and is quite hard to repackage and reuse.  &lt;em&gt;Testability&lt;/em&gt;.  It's also very difficult to construct a meaningful unit test for an &lt;strong&gt;EIM&lt;/strong&gt;  program.  &lt;em&gt;Maintainability&lt;/em&gt;.  Making simple, controlled changes can be hard:  an &lt;strong&gt;EIM&lt;/strong&gt;  program is often a house of cards.  Plus, &lt;em&gt;auditability&lt;/em&gt;  and &lt;em&gt;understandability&lt;/em&gt;  suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two arguments the get raised here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some folks argue that it's good to have &amp;quot;everything in one place&amp;quot;.  They don't like class design because they have to &amp;quot;look at something else&amp;quot; to understand an algorithm.  The &amp;quot;everything in one place&amp;quot; folks often are big-brained people who feel it important to keep all details in the forefront of their thinking; they tend to distrust summaries.  For the rest of us little-brained people, a pithy, accurate summary is essential to understanding.  We little-brained people are able to summarize a lot of software with terms like &amp;quot;OS&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;RDBMS&amp;quot;.  I don't know why similar summaries can't be used by big-brained people when doing object design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some folks argue that reuse of an EIM program can be handled through shell scripts and what-not.  This adds another element into our application, an element that reflects procedural design where the only way to bind data and processing was in an application main program.  In C, your libraries where essentially just method functions, not reusable class definitions.  Object design doesn't have this limitation, and isn't helped by writing some functionality in shell scripts and other functionality in Java.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remediation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remediation of these standard defects is hard.   If you have the &lt;strong&gt;NUT&lt;/strong&gt;  case, you have to write test cases.  Since you're writing them after the fact, they'll be incomplete.  Warning: Hard Work Required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have &lt;strong&gt;MCF&lt;/strong&gt;  programs you can sometimes rewrite them incrementally to replace dumb old Arrays and Vectors with more efficient Linked Lists, Sets and Maps.  Sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have &lt;strong&gt;NCF&lt;/strong&gt;  programs, you often have to throw them away and begin again from the beginning to write something that leverages the collection framework.  Further, you have a large education problem to solve.  Warning: Coaching and Training Required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have &lt;strong&gt;BOD&lt;/strong&gt;  programs, you have an even larger object-design education problem.  Folks who come to OO programming from non-OO environments (VB, particularly) are often baffled by the basic concept of responsibility allocation and emergent behavior from object interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that &lt;strong&gt;EIM&lt;/strong&gt;  programs are often a good way to learn better object design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="remediating-eim"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Remediating EIM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EIM programs involve a big procedure full of details that could have been summarized into other class definitions.  They also involve the obscurity of the OS's interface to a &amp;quot;program&amp;quot; and force us to write some of our application's functionality in the shell script language, diluting the value of Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to draw some lessons from the design of Ant's Task class or Maven's MOJO interface. We'll use the Ant Task definition, it's simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every &amp;quot;step&amp;quot; in a program can be defined as some kind of Task. Each Task has some configurable properties: you set those and cut the task lose to do it's job. When a Task finishes, it may have some resulting properties that you can check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EIM programs have to be recast using the &lt;strong&gt;Command&lt;/strong&gt;  design pattern.  See (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://exciton.cs.rice.edu/javaresources/DesignPatterns/command.htm"&gt;Command Design Pattern&lt;/a&gt;  for details.)  You can define a simple abstract superclass for all of the various kinds of Tasks.  You can also define a simple Macro Task that contains a List of subtasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not go insane and define &lt;strong&gt;Commands&lt;/strong&gt;  to reflect every shell-script construct (loop, conditions, switches, etc.)  Java already has all the looping and condition testing statements you'll ever need.  Feel free to invent Commands that include sensible, easy-to-summarize ordinary Java programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="atomicity"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Atomicity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you can break main into a series of atomic &amp;quot;steps&amp;quot;.  These are the big picture, summary-level small-brain steps.  If, for some reason, you can't break a 150-line pile of gibberish into some kind of summarized set of steps, find a job in a different industry.  Seriously.  If you can't summarize, you shouldn't be programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving at a summary isn't easy.  The brain's limit on comprehensibility is the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.musanim.com/miller1956/"&gt;Magical Number Seven Plus or Minus Two&lt;/a&gt; .  You have to get the overall plan down to 7±2 high-level steps.  Some of those steps can have sub-steps.  Nesting is a good thing -- just keep everything into sensible, meaningful, easy-to-describe chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each step will be largely independent.  There will be some small amount of information passed from step to step; there will also be a certain amount of shared configuration information.  Each candidate step has global properties, input from previous steps, and output to subsequent steps.  Given a 150-line morass, it may be hard to distinguish the global inputs, local inputs and outputs of each &amp;quot;step&amp;quot;.  We'll return to some specific issues below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define a subclass of Task for each step.  Some will be concrete classes -- with detailed implementations.  Some will be Macro Tasks which have constructors to create a List of subtasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each concrete Task has an execute method which is pulled directly from the original, long main method.  Each Task will also have a number of properties -- the variables required to execute the step and the results of the step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="replacing-main"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Replacing Main&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once main has been broken into Tasks, a new overall &amp;quot;What Was Formerly Main&amp;quot; Macro Task can be defined.  This will construct the 7±2 tasks that comprise the revised main sequence of steps, set their properties, and then use the ordinary Macro execute method to step through the sequence of Tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the overall main method is a simple constructor for a Macro Task and an execute of that Macro Task.  Ideally, two lines of code, based on a highly reusable Task/Macro Task structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="state-change-and-shared-state"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;State Change and Shared State&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our sequence of tasks execute, the output from one task is input to the next.  Universally, state change means that an object's setter methods were used.  Sometimes, an object which gets updated (or created) must be shared by two or more Tasks.  A shared object is usually the responsibility of the overall Macro Task, and that object is a property of each subtask which shares the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure to identify the objects which undergo state changes is the leading cause of &lt;strong&gt;EIM&lt;/strong&gt;.  It's also one of the root causes of &lt;strong&gt;BOD&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, this shared state must be persisted in some form.  (Other times, it is a report that written to some output stream.)  When we're dealing with persistent shared state, we might be using a database directly.  More often, we're using Hibernate or iBatis, and we may need to configure iBatis or Hibernate and potentially fetch some initial objects from the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="configuration-and-global-properties"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Configuration and Global Properties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public static void main method has three responsibilities.  The third and final is to create and initiate the overall Task.  The first is to gather the overall configuration as a complete set of Properties.  The java.lang.System has a base set of properties which come from Java defaults and command-line parameters.  In the middle is the management of any global objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your application should create it's own Properties object.  Use application-wide or system-wide properties files for default values.  Merge in properties from System and any property files named on the command-line.  This complete set of properties can then be given to the overall Task to support any needed configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, you may want to create shared objects outside the Task (in main), and assign these objects to specific Tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your goal is to get to something like the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
Logger theLog= Logger.getLogger( &amp;quot;com.xyzzy.division.app.Main&amp;quot; );
Properties p= mergeAllProperties();
theLog.config( p );
SomeObject theFocus= new SomeObject();
try {
    Task t0= new MainTaskV3();
    t0.init(p);
    t0.setTheFocus( theFocus );
    t0.execute();
} catch... {...}
theLog.info( &amp;quot;Finished&amp;quot; )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, my main program is purely the administrative overhead of gathering property values, creating the shared state object(s), and executing the task that updates that object's state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that we're creating MainTaskV3.  When we move to version 4, we can add the new class definition and update main to use the new class definition.  This simplifies change management to be mostly adding new class definitions and changing relatively little established, tested code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="mutability-analysis"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mutability Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we want to add a task?  In an &lt;strong&gt;EIM&lt;/strong&gt;  program, this is hard -- sometimes impossible.  In a Task-based program, we're adding a Task definition, and adding an initialization into some Macro Task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this is inherently testable.  We can easily test the new task in complete isolation.  Further, we can easily back the change out by removing a single constructor from a Macro Task.  (We don't need to remove the unused class definition.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we want to remove a Task?  Again, this is often hard in an EIM program because the various task dependencies are murky or non-existent.  In a Task-based program, we're simply removing a single constructor from a Macro Task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we want to reorder the Tasks?  We're just changing the order of SubTask construction within a Macro Task's initialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we want to dramatically restructure two formerly distinct programs and combine them into one new program?  What if we want to split a long program into two shorter programs?  Both cases are simply a re-organization of the MacroTasks to adjust the mix of tasks the create in their initialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="solutions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard defects lead to standard solutions.  Each program is not a unique, special snowflake.  Each program just one of many, and should be evaluated using a standardized set of defects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it became: &amp;quot;why not use a file system and skip the expense and overhead of an RDBMS ?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was shocked that numerous good features of the RDBMS were blissfully discarded.  Indexing?  Gone.  Separating of logical and physical storage?  Gone.  ACID rules, Locking and transaction management?  Gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I wanted to do was cut down on triggers and stored procedures.  But a true master of the false dichotomy turns that suggestion into a choice between dumb storage and the whole RDBMS bloatware that includes numerous inefficient processing choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to lift up a middle-of-the-road feature set.  Above dumb storage, but lacking the endless problems of triggers and stored procedures.  I got a bitter response: &amp;quot;How did we get on to indexes, acid and the like?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to introduce the middle ground, and was shot down.  Apparently, the RDBMS is an all-or-nothing proposition.  Since we're already holding the hammer, we might as well treat all problems as nails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-flat-file-folly"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Flat File Folly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When confronted with serious performance issues in a database application, a good approach is often to eschew complex SQL.  Indeed, the lesson I learned a few years back working on a big data warehouse was the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
SELECT * FROM SOURCE TABLE into a file.
Do all processing in Java, creating a resulting file.
Use SQL*Loader to reload the resulting file
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was told that this would clearly use too many I/O operations, making this design pattern unacceptable.  Processing must be done either entirely in SQL or entirely in memory as Java objects.  Since there were too many objects, in-memory wouldn't work, which left no choice but database processing.  There is no middle ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="optimization-in-a-vacuum"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Optimization in a Vacuum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given: some long-winded stored procedure with ill-defined semantics and no data model.  Goal: fix it.  What does &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot; mean?  Here's the deal: it's a stored procedure, but no one wants to produce the data model for the tables involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked, several times, for the context.  I was shot down.    I was told &amp;quot;I thought that I could address the programming issue of nested if's and long lists of if - elseif - elseif w/out taking into account the context/data model.&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm filled with awe at the idea of optimization without making fundamental changes to the algorithm or data structures.  It's remotely possible that the code is so brain dead as to be trivial to optimize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, this didn't seem like a false dichotomy.  Then I realized that I was being asked to separate data structure from algorithm.  Since that can't be done, it's a kind of false dichotomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="adding-a-little-hibernate"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adding A Little Hibernate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to explain that ORM's aren't an &amp;quot;incremental&amp;quot; change.  It fundamentally rearranges how you design and implement algorithms.  Which, in a way, is a kind of dichotomy.  But I don't think it's a false dichotomy.  I think that the ORM world-view is fundamentally different from one where you write long, complex stored procedures and triggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was told that &amp;quot;One guy during the meeting said that if we needed to we could use PL/SQL.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which, I suppose is true.  But it is the best way to subvert simple, clear, high-performance ORM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False dichotomy is a technique for rejecting change by going far beyond the proposed change, setting up a false dichotomy and bundling the real change in with the overstatement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case I had laid out a dichotomy as part of making a change.  This was characterized as a false dichotomy.  Sadly, no one seems to have any examples of any actual best-practice programs using Hibernate, so it stands as a false dichotomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've complained about this before.

&lt;p&gt;Compounding the problem is the casual way that some folks deal with the dimensionality of their data.  I've started working with researchers.  They know the distinction between independent and dependent variables -- it's often part of their experiment design.  However, their spreadsheet is just a flat list of columns, concealing the meaning in their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three hard parts to these kinds of problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The design of the database&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;DB design isn't always easy to deduce from the spreadsheets.  Other programs can (and often do) exacerbate the problem by claiming that a dimensionally normalized database isn't to helpful -- they just need persistent storage.  In the long run, that won't work out.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inconsistency of the spreadsheets&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;We can write rules, pass laws, build macros, rant and rave.  The spreadsheet is still a flexible desktop tool.  We can try to replace it with MS-Access, but the security model is still all-or-nothing.  If you have any access, you can add, change or delete anything you want to  touch.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting data out of an XLS file&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;There are many, many ways to approach this problem.  We might:&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the file as CSV.  There are issues here; principally, who can you trust to save the various sheets consistently?  The &amp;quot;end users&amp;quot; aren't generally all that happy with this level of technical busy-work.  Save As... is so much harder than Save that the odds of success are nearly zero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the file as XML.  This is pleasant, but again, you have to trust someone to do this correctly, since it isn't the MS-Office default.  Worse, if you try to make it the default, everyone in IT worries about the increase in file size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop using MS-Office, and use Open Office.  This has lots and lots of merit, but often suffers from goofy organizational road-blocks.  Primarily the endless list of open source &amp;quot;issues&amp;quot;: who provides support? who do we sue? bugs?  malware? licenses?  I ranted about this in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2006_04_24-the_cost_and_benefit_of_open_source.html"&gt;The Cost (and Benefit) of Open Source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write VBA scripts to convert the XLS spreadsheet to XML or a sequence of CSV files.  This compounds a yucky problem with more yuckiness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="enter-xlrd"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enter XLRD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the Open Office organization has managed to reverse engineer enough of the mystery that is XLS files.  This has two important consequences: the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://poi.apache.org/"&gt;Apache POI project&lt;/a&gt;  and the Python &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.lexicon.net/sjmachin/xlrd.htm"&gt;xlrd&lt;/a&gt;  package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With XLRD I can read the XLS file directly, cutting down on the user's busy-work to save the file in a usable format.  Using Python allows me to work through the consistency problem.  This usually leads to a class hierarchy which handles variations on the expected spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bonus is that we can unify XLRD-based readers with XML parsers to deal with a wide variety of spreadsheet data sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're still left with the remaining two hard parts -- DB design and consistency.  With Python we can easily build something meta-data driven.  In particular, we can use Python's introspection capabilities to have flexible high-level mappings from various kinds of spreadsheets to the RDBMS tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

His Type &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; and Type &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; are both stories of consultants who are brought in because they have specific skills.  In the &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; case, it's a technical skill, and in the &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; case it's project management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some of Cringley's The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2008/pulpit_20080418_004737.html"&gt;Truth About IT Consultants&lt;/a&gt;  is good stuff.  His Type &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; and Type &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; are both stories of consultants who are brought in because they have specific skills.  In the &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; case, it's a technical skill, and in the &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; case it's project management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the scope of work is narrowly defined.  Success and failure are finite and definite; it's easy to determine if the consultant is effective.  Both cases involve known requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cringley has a &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; case, however, where the consultant is brought in to a situation characterized by &amp;quot;Sometimes a customer does not know what they want&amp;quot;, which is a glib and useless summary of what really happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several variations on &amp;quot;doesn't know what they want&amp;quot;, each of which dooms the project.  With few exceptions, the customer has determined -- in advance -- that the project will be a FAIL.  Most consultants can hope to choose between FAIL and EPIC FAIL.  Cringley names one of those geniuses who can actually make a silk purse from a sow's ear.  The rest of us can only hope to make something out of the sow's ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="liars"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Liars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some customers lie.  It's a fact of life.  You're brought in to do [X].  You write a proposal to do [X].  You present this to everyone, you go through elaborate sign-off rituals.   Then the customer &amp;quot;changes scope.&amp;quot;   I call it lying, because it wasn't a surprise -- it was known by some and ignored by others.  Sadly, you're last to know that all of the quality ritual around [X] was a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases, a scope change is a FAIL; the customer ejects you for failing to do [X].  Sometimes they even admit that [X] is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers lie at every step of the process, from inception to acceptance.  What does a consultant do when they're brought in as type &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;, but the customer is lying about the problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consultant has two choices:  call them out on it, or muddle through until being ejected.  If you call them out, they might acknowledge the change in scope, and -- best of all -- treat scope change as learning, not failure.  [The odds are small, a C|net blog suggests that &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.cnet.com/8301-13505_1-9900455-16.html"&gt;62 percent of IT projects fail&lt;/a&gt; .  This means that most &amp;quot;learning&amp;quot; is still labeled &amp;quot;failure&amp;quot;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you muddle through, you wind up in Cringley's type &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; category of consultants who appear to be more problem than solution.  You'll be blamed for &amp;quot;running the meter&amp;quot; while the project crashed and burned.  But really, the project was already dead; the project was dead as soon as the customer admitted they didn't know what they wanted.  It isn't possible to &amp;quot;take a long hard look at the ROI&amp;quot; when at least some of the folks are lying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="problem-free-problem-solving"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problem-Free Problem Solving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some customers have an iron-bound process.  They insist on [X].  You provide [X], and they confess that [X] didn't solve their problem.  'You did an excellent job and built exactly what we asked for; it’s just not what we really want.' TC quotes.  Essentially, the customer demanded technology, independent of the problem being solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has a lot of FAIL in it.  If you deliver the technology, the problem isn't solved.  If you attempt to solve the problem, you aren't following the agreed-upon scope or approach.  Both paths are FAIL.  EPIC FAIL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="helpless-flailing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Helpless Flailing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some customers like to paint their situation as one in which they are helpless or powerless.  They just don't know what to do next.  The situation is so dire, that they demand a type &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; consultant to help them decide what to do.  This is actually a composite situation, with two parts, both with a lot of FAIL in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;They are lying about the scope and nature of the work.  &amp;quot;Help us decide&amp;quot; isn't true, and &amp;quot;help is implement&amp;quot; can't be true until the decision part is finished.  The situation is usually a conflict where someone in power wants the wrong solution and someone without a lot of power or influence is only able to raise doubts, but can't actually change any minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get to agreement, someone must be rewarded for doing the right thing.  Consultants rarely shape the cultural and financial reward systems.  The customer must elevate the value of cooperation, and must elevate the values of the right solution.  The consultant can only point the direction, the customer has to actually move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;They are failing to confront the problem.  Sometimes, this is because an executive made a bad decision in the past, creating the problem, and would like to have it solved without any shadow of blame.  Other times this is because there's a favorite technology out there, and we don't want to document the problem just build a solution.  No formal definition of a problem means endless back-and-forth on the technology.  If you can't prove that it solves some (or all) of the problem, consulting won't help make a technology choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, to get to an agreement, you need some kind of reward for doing the right thing.  If we don't have a problem, and we can't reward people for solving the problem, all we have left is waffling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="roi"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ROI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about ROI?  Isn't that a good measure for consulting success?  Shouldn't we hold the type &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; consultant to an ROI metric?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But only if you have a measurement system you can use to gauge the return.  Rarely is this in place.  &amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; you ask, &amp;quot;Aren't financial measures always in place?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure they are, but do they apply to the technology you're playing with?  Or do they apply to the business problem you're supposed to be solving?  And if no one will clearly state the business problem, how can we make ROI metrics apply?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's absolutely essential to clearly state the business problem.  Then, picking a solution, is a facilitated discussion, done by a type &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; consultant.  Then, the implementation is a project managed by type &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; consultants and staffed by type &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cringley can complain about type &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; consultants.  But customers create the situations in which consultants fail.  And consultants hate to piss customers off by declaring a project full of FAIL before they even start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-fantasy-solution"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Fantasy Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cringely describes a common customer fantasy.  &amp;quot;The best consultants are the ones who come with a portfolio of products and tools. &amp;quot;  While pleasant, this is rare.  There are four common outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client has either chosen the solution -- or is open to change -- and found a consultant who can implement it.  Good.  Unless, of course, we're in &lt;strong&gt;Problem-Free Problem Solving&lt;/strong&gt;  mode.  In which case, a great implementation solves nothing.  It's still a FAIL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client is a &lt;strong&gt;Liar&lt;/strong&gt;  about being open to change.  Go ahead, install the solution AND solve the problem.  You can still be labeled a failure if there's no &amp;quot;uptake&amp;quot; of the solution.  It can stand out as an island of stuff that is repudiated because it's unique.  There is no reward for learning the new technology, so it has to be removed.  FAIL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The client is engaged in &lt;strong&gt;Helpless Flailing&lt;/strong&gt; , but isn't actually open to the technology or admitting to the business problem (or both).  Now you look like you're selling snake oil and making insane promises no technology can keep.  They may like you, and you may have identified the real problem for them.  But if your technology isn't what they want, that's a FAIL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stars align.  They are confronting the real problem, they like and embrace (or already use) the technology.  Wait.  That's the type &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; or type &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; consulting gig -- where the requirements and technology are known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic rule is this: Cringely's Type &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; and Type &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; are places where the customer's done some homework, aligned solution with problem, and has a clear scope of work to actually solve the actual problem.  Everything else has a lot of FAIL in it because the customer's unwilling or unable to do the work required AND the consultant is unwilling to make this clear before starting.  It takes two to FAIL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The first recent failure of use cases was particularly alarming.  It was a small application; a few use cases, a couple of actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the actors was labeled as &amp;quot;End User&amp;quot;.  Seriously.  Few labels could be as vague as End User, except perhaps calling an actor &amp;quot;Actor&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bunch of the use cases were essentially a GUI specification, which isn't completely wrong.  However, a GUI spec usually requires a ton of background and justification.  Often, a GUI spec relies on an underlying model and a bunch of context that provides the &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked for higher-level use cases to try and drive out what the content of the underlying model really was.  Without the context information, all we knew were GUI objects like characters and cursors and fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was told -- by the author -- that it was not possible to describe the application in any terms other than the GUI specification.  It was not possible to write a use case at a higher level; it was not possible that one could minimize the technology dependence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I provided two strategies, the author was 'incapable' of doing either one.  Strategy 1: write multiple drafts, each using a different technology, compare and contrast the resulting drafts to get the &amp;quot;essential&amp;quot; material.  Strategy 2: underline the technology words in red and replace them with something less specific to SWING.  Both were largely impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequence: someone has to guess at the underlying model.  That will work out great when -- part way though implementing the GUI -- someone discovers all the things left out of the essential model.  They'll then retro-fit the high-level use cases; usually around the partial implementation so that none of the &amp;quot;investment&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;lost&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bunching"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bunching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another use case problem stemmed from a situation I'll call &amp;quot;Improper Bunching&amp;quot;.  A bunch of steps were described as a long use case and allocated to a single actor.  The steps don't really share information and business value; they contribute, but they aren't all the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, a few of the steps could be performed by any of a large number of actors.  All of the candidates had the requisite knowledge, the authority to act and compatible business goals.  The choice of actor is really one of &amp;quot;who has the time to do the job&amp;quot;, not &amp;quot;who has the knowledge to do the job.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bunching, however, conflated the long sequence of steps with the smaller steps.  While some elements of the long sequence couldn't be shared of off-loaded, some of the individual steps could be assigned in different ways to change the way people were task-loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequence:  The long sequence of steps dominates everyone's thinking.  Worse, it takes some work-flow alternatives off the table; and this takes some technology off the table.  Specifically, it prevents doing things in parallel in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Taxonomy of Mistakes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's my taxonomy of common use case mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Not Interactive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only Features and Technology - no actual interactions between actor and system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only Algorithms - no people - the use case is dominated by algorithms and processing details, actors are left out of the picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;No Business Value&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Incomplete&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.1.1.  Focus on Sequential Operations - usually login and initial setup; some business operations omitted or summarized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.1.2.  Following the Precedent - rewriting previous business operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.1.3.  Bunching - use cases are long sequences that could be decomposed into smaller, reusable, independent steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Non-Specific&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.2.1.  Free-Running Imagination - conflating &amp;quot;possibly&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;required&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Tech Specs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.3.1.  The use cases are technical requirements - the solution technology is conflated with the business problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.3.2.  The use cases are detailed design - the business problem is never stated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;No Actor - Often associated with a non-interactive use case&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="use-cases-for-this-taxonomy"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use Cases for this Taxonomy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's helpful to summarize the common use case mistakes with a common set of names.  The mistakes are prevalent.  Having a common names for these mistakes gives people a gentle reminder on the quality problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn't helpful to have a bad set of use cases.  When the author dismisses corrections as &amp;quot;that's not my understanding&amp;quot; we now have two problems: broken use cases and someone who doesn't want to help fix them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle use case for this taxonomy is to help coach the authors.  If they have &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; use case errors, then there are equally standard fixes.  It isn't a gross failure, it's just standard quality issues that everyone has.  The author isn't a moron; this is just a review to find the common kinds of errors and omissions.  The use case review isn't a trial by jury, it's just a chance to find and fix a few mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

These can be tackled a number of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What spoils me is the Object Relational Mapping (ORM) in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/"&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/a&gt;  and the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt;  ORM layer (among others).  With SQLAlchemy I can create Mapper that bridges between a &lt;strong&gt;Plain Old Python Object&lt;/strong&gt;  and a SQLAlchemy table definition.  The Table definition really SQL with &lt;strong&gt;Good Old Python Syntax&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Django, the two Python and SQL are combined -- a Django table definition is also a POPO.  There are some limitations, but not too many.  Most importantly, navigation may imply additional queries which are handled silently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working with X12 and XML messages, I want similar coolness.  I thought I wanted POPO's, until I got a comment leading me to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/2007/08/02/atom-models/"&gt;Atom Models&lt;/a&gt; ; that clarified the distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="popo"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;POPO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While using Plain Old Python Objects is a lofty ideal, it isn't always practical.  If we want purely Python objects then we have three-step unmarshalling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lexical&lt;/strong&gt;.  This breaks the source text into tokens.  Either XML constructs like tags and text or X12 constructs like Segments and Elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Syntactical&lt;/strong&gt;.  This assembles meaningful objects from the tokens.  This is either XML elements and attributes (properly nested) or X12 Loops, Segments, Composites and Elements (again, properly nested).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POPO&lt;/strong&gt;.  This builds the desired POPO objects out of the XML (or X12) structure, through a big-old structure-by-structure mapping.  When you work with tools like the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sun.com/software/javaenterprisesystem/javacaps/index.jsp"&gt;Java CAPS&lt;/a&gt;  eDesigner (or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.softwareag.com/corporate/products/wm/default.asp"&gt;webMethods&lt;/a&gt; ) you spend a fair amount of time dragging mapping lines from one structure to another structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Ian Bicking points out in the Atom Models, you now have three representations: text, XML and your final POPO.  That's at least one too many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a helpful insight, and it highlights the distinction between POPO and GOPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="gops"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GOPS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian's claim is that a better approach is wrapping the syntactical representation in Good Old Python Syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a couple of alternatives here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subclass the built-in classes to add the desirable syntax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build Bridge/Facades over the the built-in structures.  This allows us to offer GOPS, but this syntax is really a pass-through to the underlying objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are reasons for both.  Ordinary subclassing, while appealing, may leave you rooting around in things that are Rat Holes of Lost Time.   On the other hand, a Bridge/Facade has a possible disadvantage of leading to rather complex constructors, since the bridge is really a pass-through to some underlying structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when trying to cope with xml.dom.minidom, a Bridge or Facade makes sense.  It gives us better search than the minidom getElementsByName capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="aha"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aha&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I've got several toweringly complex XML messages that have to be synthesized.  I don't want to hard code a big puddle of XML text.  In the future, I may get a proper XSD for the message, from which the various elements can be built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I don't have XSD or DTD, just a few examples plus an MS-Word .doc with message elements in a big, indented layout.  Creating proper POPO's for this hierarchy isn't too bad.  I have a simple parser that transforms an indented outline into Python class definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a Bridge to XML, similarly, isn't too bad.  It just makes the POPO's a bit more complex.  Each element is a descriptor that contains navigation into the underlying XML.  Creating a message from scratch adds enough complexity that it's a headache.  Either we introspect our POPO's or do additional parsing of the indented layout to create an XML constructor in addition to the Bridge class definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real win however, will come from upgrading to the 1.3 release of ElementTree, which has more complete XPath support.  The ElementTree find method provides a pleasant, Pythonic encapsulation of the XPath that makes life relatively simple.  Bridges and Facades are no longer desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-hierarchy-parser"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Hierarchy Parser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a way to parse a big block o' text and create a proper XML structure from the content.  Similar algorithms can be used to emit Python class definitions, XML loop structures, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message is the top-level Element.  The description is simple indented block of text, for example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
someMsg= &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
HTML
    HEAD
        TITLE
    BODY
        P
        P
&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
import xml.etree.ElementTree as dom
def makeXML( message, description ):
    msg= dom.Element( message )
    indent= [ (-1,msg) ]
    for lineRaw in description.splitlines():
        line= lineRaw.rstrip()
        if len(line) == 0: continue
        tag= line.lstrip()
        spaces = line.find(tag[0])
        prevSpaces, context = indent[-1]
        if spaces &amp;lt; prevSpaces:
            # outdent: pop to matching level, then pop to this level
            while spaces &amp;lt; prevSpaces:
                indent.pop(-1)
                prevSpaces, context = indent[-1]
            assert spaces == prevSpaces
        if spaces == prevSpaces:
            # prevailing indent: pop to parent
            indent.pop(-1)
            prevSpaces, context = indent[-1]
            assert spaces &amp;gt; prevSpaces
        # indent: append a child
        new= dom.SubElement( context, tag )
        indent.append( (spaces,new) )
    spaces, topElt = indent[0]
    return dom.ElementTree( topElt )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I'm happy.  I can unmarshall and marshall using ElementTree.  I can manipulate with simple things like &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;msg.find(&amp;quot;SOME/NESTED/PART&amp;quot;).text&lt;/span&gt; = &amp;quot;new value&amp;quot;&lt;/tt&gt; .  I can build using the above &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;makeXML&lt;/tt&gt;  function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I've been working on applications that involve a fair amount of manipulation of XML and X12.  Recently I started yet another, and started to recognize the essential design patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four use cases.  The first two use cases define the interface: marshall and unmarshall.  The third and fourth use cases are building and manipulating the internal objects, separate from any XML (or X12) considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem recently gave me brain cramps because I wanted something a bit more general than my last (ad-hoc) go-around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Use Cases are written from the viewpoint of the Plain Old Python Objects (POPO) application.  While my inbound and outbound interface is XML (or X12), I don't want a program full of text manipulation.  I want to unmarshall the input text into a POPO, work with that POPO and marshall the output as text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="use-case-1-marshall"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use Case 1: Marshall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first use case is the easy one: Marshalling.  We want a POPO to marshall itself into an XML (or X12 message).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="use-case-2-unmarshall-or-parse"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use Case 2: Unmarshall (or parse)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is solved by SAX, expat, xml.dom.minidom and xml.etree, there are some distinctions that are important.  The &amp;quot;event-based&amp;quot; parsing of SAX or expat is only part of the use case.  The more important part is the creation of a resulting document object that can be used for further processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This document is easiest to work with if it's built of POPO's.  The &amp;quot;manipulation&amp;quot; use case, below, depends on simple, elegant Python syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="use-case-3-build"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use Case 3: Build&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In additional to receiving XML documents that encode POPO objects, we also need to build POPO objects &amp;quot;from scratch&amp;quot; in Python programs.  The point of POPO's is to have ordinary Python constructors building a complex object that can be manipulated and marshalled as XML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="use-case-4-popo-manipulation"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use Case 4: POPO Manipulation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be able to say things like &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;msg.LOOP1.DTP.DTP02= &amp;quot;20080330&amp;quot;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Python &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; is much, much cleaner than the rather complex search references required by the xml.dom structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this isn't the only construct I'd like.  Many XML (and X12) constructs can repeat, so we need to use the &amp;quot;[]&amp;quot; or insert a number in the &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XPath is not particularly pleasant for this, since it is not very Pythonic.  [XPath is a useful model, however, because the navigation axes can serve as a template for method design.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="solutions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of solutions, most of them icky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;xml.dom.minidom&lt;/tt&gt;.  I liked this, right up until yesterday, when I read` Python HTML Parser Performance &amp;lt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/2008/03/30/python-html-parser-performance/"&gt;http://blog.ianbicking.org/2008/03/30/python-html-parser-performance/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;`_ .  It wasn't the &amp;quot;performance&amp;quot; topic that caught my attention, it was the &amp;quot;I do not recommend using minidom for anything&amp;quot; quote that stopped me cold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A kind of &lt;strong&gt;Bridge&lt;/strong&gt;  to create usable POPO's which are a Bridge to the xml.dom model implemented in minidom.  This isn't a pure Bridge, but a kind of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_pattern"&gt;Bridge&lt;/a&gt; -meets-&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa%C3%A7ade_pattern"&gt;Facade&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom POPO's.  This requires parsing using a custom (but not too complex) SAX ContentHandler and a simple XML marshaller method of each POPO class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ElementTree&lt;/tt&gt;.  This was new to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;minidom&lt;/tt&gt; solution has two use cases nailed -- marshall and unmarshall fit nicely.  Building doesn't work out so well because the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;document.createElement&lt;/tt&gt; construction is very clunky.  Manipulation is also a pain in the neck because the navigation capabilities are limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Bridge to A Footing&amp;quot; is something I'd used recently.  In that case, the footing wasn't &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;minidom&lt;/tt&gt;, but was a low-level representation of X12 messages.  Extending it, however, showed some profound limitations in my original design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that each attribute of a Bridge class is implemented as a Python descriptor.  The descriptor's  __get__ method implements the requisite search.  Marshall, Unmarshall and Manipulation are really quite nice.  Building, however, gets complicated.  Mostly because we still have to build the underlying minidom representation from Bridge objects that are heavily biased toward search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Custom POPO's work out moderately well.  The Python classes parallel the XSD's or DTD's or SEF's of the original message structure.  This isn't always ideal, however, since we have to define every single tag in a complex message structure.  For large X12 messages, this is a LOT of definitions of elements that simply pass through our application.  Its much nicer to have generic definitions (like minidom) that define the bulk of the data and a Bridge that applies to the useful parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-element-tree-solution"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Element Tree Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Element Tree is new with Python 2.5 and corrects many problems with xml.dom.minidom.  Principally, ElementTree is Pythonic, not a rehash of a Java design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Marshall and Unmarshall use cases work out reasonably well.  I have a beef with ElementTree.write, since that always creates a file.  But, I worked around it with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
def toXML( etree ):
    buffer= StringIO.StringIO()
    etree.write( buffer )
    txt= buffer.getvalue()
    buffer.close()
    return txt
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, I should subclass &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ElementTree&lt;/tt&gt; and incorporate this into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building an Element Tree isn't too bad.  The Element and SubElement constructors are easy enough to use.  The text attribute (missing from the documentation) helps set text values of tags without fuss or complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manipulating, similarly, isn't awful.  The (currently undocumented) ElementPath module provides a &amp;quot;name/name&amp;quot; XPath-like search functionality.  However, the way that the ElementPath (or _SimpleElementPath) plug into the overall structure of the find method shows how to build more sophisticated versions of ElementPath that handle more complex XPath search axes.  The nasty part of this is parsing the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath"&gt;XPath notation&lt;/a&gt;  itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Specifically, abbreviated notation, which limits searches to the child axis.  The &amp;quot;[&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;]&amp;quot; index construct and &amp;quot;[&amp;#64; &lt;em&gt;attr&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt;]&amp;quot; constructs are the most useful.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to write message.loop1.dtp, but I'm willing to settle for message.find(&amp;quot;loop1/dtp&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="thanks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one knew I was having a problem with manipulating complex XML and X12 messages.  But the answer just sort of dropped into my lap by virtual of some cosmic synchronicity.  Or maybe chance favors the prepared mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

In a way, a configuration is a highly-specialized Domain Specific Language focused on the application's problem domain.  The point is to leverage syntax we already have to create meaningful configuration files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Python is sometimes a good use for a configuration language -- such as in Django.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's true that Django does this elegantly, I'd been doing something more complex than Django's relatively clear and simple approach.  My example in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2008_01_19-two_python_config_file_design_patterns.html"&gt;Two Python Config-File Design Patterns&lt;/a&gt;  was a structural definition that was difficult to express in any other language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structural configuration file was more like Django's Model definitions than a simple &amp;quot;configuration&amp;quot; file.  However, in a very real sense, it is the model which configures Django to have the data elements we want to display and persist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've used the &lt;strong&gt;Structural Declaration&lt;/strong&gt;  pattern a number of times.  I cribbed it from the packages like urllib2 where you build up a fairly complex object from component parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="malicious-code"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Malicious Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It's a security vulnerability.&amp;quot;  While technically true that you might get &amp;quot;malicious&amp;quot; configuration from a support forum, this is an easy vulnerability to prevent.  It's configuration.  It should be obvious what it is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the configuration starts to look like code -- i.e., it is no longer a strictly declarative construction -- then an architectural design expectation has been violated.  Any doubt about the content of a configuration file is a red-alert, class 1, fatal defect.  Epic Fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Apache configuration, for example, has code-like pattern-matching and decision-making rules.  This is a compromise because Apache needs speed, and also needs flexibility.  For this kind of thing, I would prefer a Plain-Old Python extension as a proper subclass that extends the framework.  Subclasses and extensions can preserve the distinction between &amp;quot;a few constants that are reused heavily and likely to change&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;more code to handle special cases.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="syntax-woes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Syntax Woes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;By using Python as your configuration syntax, you force your users to learn the idiosyncrasies of Python syntax when configuring.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting point.  I'll counter with the observation that XML syntax is opaque and .INI syntax is more obscure that Python syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of a configuration file is specifically not to write code.  The lowest level of configuration is a Django-style sequence of simple assignment statements (which is almost precisely the same syntax as an .INI file.)  The higher level is a more complex structural declaration that is more clear in Python than any .INI file.  (I know, I had to struggle with an .INI file that was a total mystery.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, &amp;quot;Configuration files cease to work whenever Python changes.&amp;quot;  I'm not sure how to interpret this.  Since the application is in Python, the whole house of cards collapses when Python changes.  The configuration is the least of my worries.  If I had a program in C that merely imported the Python interpreter to parse a configuration file, perhaps there's something to this consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="diagnostics"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diagnostics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Errors in configuration files can be hard to diagnose for users, as it may not be clear whether the error arose from the configuration or the app itself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting point.  There is a handy trick for this, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
try:
    execfile('config.py')
except Exception, e:
    logging.exception(&amp;quot;Configuration Syntax:&amp;quot;, str(e))
    sys.exit(2)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could, additionally, check for Python SyntaxError specifically.  We could also manipulate the traceback to produce more meaningful error messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="preventing-problems"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preventing Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;malicious code injection&amp;quot; problem is good way to talk about good design and bad design.  A reasonably careful design and a little bit of looking at the configuration file will prevent problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Additionally, if someone is in the habit of simply installing files they got from a support forum, then perhaps they should consider a different line of work.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This malice consideration says that we need a design that makes it trivial for anyone to vet a configuration file for malicious code.  This vet-ability (a kind of maintainability) is central to any good configuration file design, irrespective of syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;syntax&amp;quot; consideration is one of the strengths of Python.  Python syntax (for assignment statements) is as simple as .INI files, and more flexible.  The idea that the core syntax of the assignment statement could change -- while remotely possible -- isn't on the horizon any time soon.  I'm perfectly confident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the diagnostics issue gives us another direction for good design.  Any configuration file can have serious problems with improper data.  I've seen very sophisticated modules to read, parse and report problems in .INI files.  Personally, I'd like to leave out the reading and parsing part and focus on the problem detection and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rules"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've found a few moderately complex problems where .INI files are too simple.  The amount of crapola that has to be done to describe the configuration exceeds the capabilities of .INI files.  That's when Python really pays out handsome rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, make the application robust enough that the configuration file is simple and can be inspected by someone other than the application's author.  The meaning should be manifest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, make the configuration simple enough that it doesn't use too much Python syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, make is easy to diagnose syntax problems; leverage what Python already does for us.  We can then concentrate on the semantics of the configuration file.  It's all about the meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Rather than provide an alternative or improvement, this passive kind of aggression raises things which are &amp;quot;potential&amp;quot; problems or issues.  Things which serve only to raise doubts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach plays into the hands of risk-averse management.  It works really well with managers who directly equate risks with actual costs.  If, for example, there's a small chance that some component or product might be too slow, a risk-ignorant manager will hear you saying the component doesn't work.  They'll hear the train-wreck of their career in shambles because of this one component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A passive-aggressive programmer or DBA can support a risk-ignorant manager by providing the kinds of technical opinions that the manager loves to hear.  It's important to spot these so that you aren't enmeshed in a valueless discussion -- you need to redirect the P/A programmer to fact-based reasoning, not an exchange of low-probability potential defects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="all-or-nothing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All or Nothing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first argument technique is &amp;quot;False Dichotomy&amp;quot;.  It allows one to (passively) do very little to (aggressively) undermine all progress that doesn't fit with the DBA's agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of this came up while trying to walk through an Agile process.  Note that a passive-aggressive doesn't have a &lt;em&gt;stated&lt;/em&gt;  agenda.  To me, it looks like the DBA's agenda is to begin with detailed design, preferrably focused on a confusing GUI feature like the tree display of a hierarchy.  When asked, however, they're just &amp;quot;looking for help.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what they said (paraphrased):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don't know what I'm doing because I don't understand the process, and therefore I can't execute.  For me to understand the process, I have to ask &amp;quot;Why&amp;quot; and have every step and deliverable justified.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the two false dichotomies in this argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are ONLY two choices: full interrogation over every nuance (with and endless series of &amp;quot;why should we do that?&amp;quot; questions) or no questions of any kind.  Other questions (who? what? when? where? how?) don't seem to exist.  Of course, they can't exist for a true passive/aggressive because the intermediate level of understanding isn't passive enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are ONLY two levels of understand: ALL or NONE.  Merely having a short list of the means which lead to the desired ends isn't possible.  It isn't totally passive, it requires some effort to gain an overview of the process without all the details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="getting-out-of-the-trap"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Out of the Trap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confronted with questions on methodology, my first instinct was to explain and justify Agile techniques.  That didn't work because it got bogged down in the &amp;quot;Why&amp;quot; questions which amounted to &amp;quot;Why not just do it my way?  Why not do Big Design Up Front?&amp;quot; I couldn't see any use case, so it wasn't clear to me what -- if any -- point there was to all the coding.  Beginning at the beginning (with the users) appears to be anethema.  Of course, a true passive/aggressive won't say anything, they just won't do anything, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second attempt was to use a &amp;quot;just try it&amp;quot; (sometimes called the &amp;quot;shut up and move forward&amp;quot; approach).  That didn't work, either.  Consistent with the passivity, there is no sense of &amp;quot;forward&amp;quot;, apparently.  Each activity (define an actor, write a use case, prioritize, update the architecture, write test cases, etc.) appears as just another zero-value &amp;quot;make-work&amp;quot; step executed in a complete intellectual vacuum.  The passive/aggressive can't know everything, so they must know nothing [See?  There's no middle ground.]  How the activities fit together is, consequently, unknowable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next attempt (sigh) is going to be Socratic Method -- what do you think you're doing?  why are you doing it? what's the value? what are the means? what are the ends? who's your audience?  That will likely turn into the endless series of &amp;quot;Why's&amp;quot; -- except this time from my side to try and illuminate the costs of a waterfall approach; worse, an approach that begins with detailed design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="if-you-say-so"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If You Say So&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another popular argument technique is a kind of &amp;quot;Appeal to Authority&amp;quot; that absolves the P/A of responsibility.  Here's a recent quote from a DBA -- a DBA who knows Java, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you say that it can be done, I am sure that it can be done.  I don't know enough Java to be able to do this. I will assume that professional Java developers will know how to do this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the DBA is declaring that there is risk of failure; the risk stems from a murky Java technique; the technique is so murky that &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; software folks can't understand it; therefore, the risk is so certain that it is essentially a cost (not a probability of a cost, but a direct cost).  The DBA is absolutely sure that no one can do the required programming.  The DBA knows Java, that's not the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the topic?  Logging changes from the &lt;strong&gt;setter&lt;/strong&gt;  methods of a class. This is the canonical example of the &lt;strong&gt;Memento&lt;/strong&gt;  design pattern, implemented as a common aspect of the set methods.  It can be done, trivially, by adding a subclass to the java.util.logger that will write specialized log entries to a database table.  [The logging itself can be added as an aspect using an annotation.]  Indeed, this is summarized in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/reference/aop.html"&gt;Chapter 6&lt;/a&gt;  of the Spring 2.0.x manual.  Also, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/244373/Advanced-Spring-Framework"&gt;http://www.scribd.com/doc/244373/Advanced-Spring-Framework&lt;/a&gt;  and many other places that describe the intimate relationship between Spring, Hibernate and Annotations.  Examples include &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.devx.com/Java/Article/30799"&gt;http://www.devx.com/Java/Article/30799&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that the specific technique of logging changes in a set method is being questioned.  Perhaps it's something else.  I can't say; primarily because I can't get more detailed objections defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative appears to be some kind of Interceptor in Hibernate which captures all changes and logs them.  See &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.hibernate.org/195.html"&gt;http://www.hibernate.org/195.html&lt;/a&gt;  for the code.  This interceptor, of course, would be part of Hibernate, divorced from the application; making it difficult to configure properly.  You rarely need audit logging of &amp;quot;everything&amp;quot;; it's usually focused on critical pieces of information.  Further, you need to know what the audit log &amp;quot;means&amp;quot;.  Simply logging all kinds of random DB changes never very meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="prevention"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prevention&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to prevent False Dichotomy arguments.  Many non-technical types want things &amp;quot;simplified&amp;quot; and will demand enough simplification until they get to a false dichotomy.  If you provide additional information, it's deprecated as &amp;quot;needless nuance&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;technical hand-wringing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best you can do is keep using phrases like &amp;quot;amongst other choices&amp;quot; to emphasize that the dichotomy is a simplification, not the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appeals to Authority are even harder to prevent.  You cannot address these without working code.  Omit any part of the application from a Proof of Concept (or Technology Spike) and you may have opened the door for further &amp;quot;if you say so, but we still don't believe it&amp;quot; conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative answer is to provide the supplemental education.  The reluctant DBA would have to actually learn a tiny bit more Java programming to see what a getter/setter is all about. And they don't have time for this; they prefer to assert that a common aspect across all setter methods is &amp;quot;risky&amp;quot; without defining the actual risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usual form of this is  A is not NULL AndAlso A != &amp;quot; &amp;quot;.  The inverse is A is NULL OrElse A = &amp;quot; &amp;quot;.  Any other variation on these two is a common logic error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what test cases are we inserting to show we reverse engineered this correctly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="craposity"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Craposity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I can do is gripe about the level of craposity that accretes around VB.  A colleague noted that the .NET environment doesn't do this, it's just shoddy craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noted that it seems to be all I ever see -- really spankingly shoddy VB code. Indeed, I got a brain cramp of the first magnitude yesterday looking at the example shown above; code that -- merely by inspection -- could be shown to do nothing useful.  And, of course, most VB products as a whole was built with COPY-Relocate-and-PASTE (&lt;strong&gt;CRAP&lt;/strong&gt;™) reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to agree that it probably isn't the toolset.  That leads me to deduce that either all VB programmers are idiots or my sample is biased.  It must be that I only look at code that's &amp;quot;too expensive to maintain in its current form&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="but-it-solves-a-problem"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But It Solves A Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that any random idiot is capable of solving a business problem with a program that's an atrocity in .EXE format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leads me to conclude that business problems (generally) are so Huge and Obvious that it doesn't take any skill at all to find and solve them.  Which leads me to ask why we require armies of Business Analysts, Program Managers, Directors of Software Development and what-not.  All of that management oversight doesn't stop a class-A idiot from writing a deeply disturbing pile of code which becomes an organizational lynch-pin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, is all that management oversight the cause of the idiocy, not a failure to stop the idiocy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Magic Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JB noted that some programmers work through a process of voodoo and witchcraft, and don't really understand much of what they're doing.  Hence the prevalence of COPY-Relocate-and-PASTE reuse.  They can't refactor because they're not sure it's really appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management, of course, forces this to happen by imposing nutball schedules and demanding that useful work stop because it's &amp;quot;gold plating&amp;quot;.  While lack of skills is the cause, management's policy is to enable bad behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that improvements can only happen by magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

ERwin uses &amp;quot;physical&amp;quot; model to mean &amp;quot;product-specific logical&amp;quot; model.  They use &amp;quot;logical&amp;quot; to mean &amp;quot;product-independent logical&amp;quot; model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ERwin doesn't do &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt;  modeling.  Not even a little bit.  The physical layer of a relational database occurs down at the file system level.  Codd's &amp;quot;Rule 8&amp;quot; (Physical Data Independence) says that the things we're designing in ERwin (and similar tools) are the things our application depends on; the things we're &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;  designing, therefore, must be physical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical implementations underlying Oracle, Postgres, DB2, MySQL, SQL/Server (and even SQLite) are all different.  These physical models have &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;  to do with the SQL standard; that's the central tenet of Codd's Rule 8.  These implementations are so different as to defy a standardized modeling tool.  All you can ever use for physical modeling is a generic UML tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="compression"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was asked about the value of compression.  Years ago, we depended on the clever compression schemes of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/rdb/index.html"&gt;Oracle RDB&lt;/a&gt; .  Oracle 10g has table compression.  DB2 has tablespace compression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a physical design technique.  It's invisible to the SQL application programmer.  It can speed up certain types of queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final trade-offs can only be determined empirically.  You have to process real data through a reasonably complete application to get a benchmark.  Then you rework your database to compress things and see if it runs faster where you need it to run faster, and hasn't gotten any worse elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was shocked that someone would ask about the value of compression.  Anything that involves a table scan will be faster with compressed data.  Fewer physical reads means faster.  It's that simple.  (Yes, there's a CPU cost, the impact depends on the actual mix of updates, inserts and selects.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to probe the DBA to see precisely what the confusion was, but didn't get much of an answer.  As near as I can tell, there are some restrictions imposed by Oracle on how one can alter a compressed table; this had somehow confounded things.  As a practical matter, the restrictions imposed by the RDBMS don't matter much.  Many database structural changes are the kind of thing that can't be done with ALTER; you have to clone the old table, drop and rebuild it, and then reload the new table(s) from the clone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Administration aside, compression is simple.  For data warehouses, it helps a lot.  You have to measure the impact across all use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="partitioning"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Partitioning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was asked about partitioning.   Oracle has some performance tuning guidelines which were bothersome or confusing or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that there are several dimensions to partitioning.  One can do &amp;quot;vertical&amp;quot; partitioning where a table is split into two portions that have a mandatory 1:1 relationship.  This can be done to separate data elements, potentially improving concurrency.  This is a logical design technique, since an application programmer will have to know which partition has the appropriate columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;horizontal&amp;quot; partition splits a table into sections that can be allocated to multiple physical tablespaces.  This is a physical design technique, since it's invisible to the SQL programmer.  Partitions can be defined around some key or can be more-or-less arbitrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to spread the I/O load around among multiple devices, improving concurrency.  This isn't like compression, where we do fewer reads.  However, doing the reads concurrently can improve the elapsed time to query data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that storage arrays often do this for us, seamlessly, silently and outside the database.  If we define the right kind of striped logical volume, then the file system itself will spread the file blocks across multiple physical locations.  The kind of sequential read that implements a table scan will work with multiple, concurrent physical reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the file system can't do this, we can have the RDBMS do it.  Having it done in both tiers of the architecture is actually bad because one tier can undo the other tier's performance optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tuning"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tuning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle says that -- if you can -- keep your partition sizes approximately equal.  This is silly advice, since it can be very hard to implement.  Your data has the distribution it has.  Further, the equal-sized partition rule is only to get &amp;quot;optimal&amp;quot; performance.  If all partitions are about the same size, they can all be scanned in about the same amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one partition is bigger, it will be slower.  This may be sub-optimal, but it still beats the performance of an unpartitioned table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &amp;quot;balancing&amp;quot; issue becomes a kind of fetish for DBA's.  They start to do sophisticated statistical summaries and analysis of the various keys trying to locate a way to even out the partition sizes consistent with the application design and architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can become a burdensome load of hooey.  Use partitions that make sense.  For those rare, ultra-high-performance applications, use a hash partition and be happy knowing it's faster than unpartitioned data.  Don't fetishize about keeping the partitions equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="vsam-files"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;VSAM Files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/pdthelp/v1r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.entcobol4.doc/cpvsm04.htm"&gt;VSAM&lt;/a&gt;  flat-files are still in use.  All VSAM I/O (in spite of the V meaning &amp;quot;Virtual&amp;quot;) is essentially physical I/O.  VSAM files can be read, written, and searched using ultra-complex algorithms.  Algorithms that aren't remotely compatible with SQL's simplified view of the world.  I know, I wrote some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, we've spent a lot of time talking about replacing some VSAM files with a proper relational database.  The fantasy is that we can neatly excise this physical I/O and replace it with SQL statements, leaving the rest of the program more-or-less intact.  Clearly, they haven't spent enough time trying to reverse engineer COBOL programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COBOL programs that process VSAM files rarely have a structure that involves an algorithm like a simple cursor fetch loop or SQL update statement.  Instead, these programs have obscure structures that depend on numerous details of the file organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="unifying-theme"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unifying Theme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the unifying theme: a few programmers have gotten so used to SQL that they think it's low-level I/O.  They've forgotten the underlying physical implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They've lost sight of the physical reads and how reducing the physical reads makes table scans go faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They've fetishized subtle load-balancing issues, forgetting that any parallel I/O is better than no parallel I/O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They think that all programs have elegant SQL-like fetch loops, updates or inserts.  Legacy COBOL programs can be peculiarly obscure.  It is often simpler to dispose of the old VSAM program rather than rewrite it to use SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Those who choose to argue this point might like to explain the recurring customer comment 'You did an excellent job and built exactly what we asked for; it’s just not what we really want.'&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love that customer comment.  It's an admission that the &amp;quot;write requirements, get bids, monitor the contract&amp;quot; waterfall model of software procurement doesn't work for our customers.  This kind of quote means that they'll be open to a practice that tackles problems rather than manages creation of deliverables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things that sold Agile methods to me are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software is Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;. This means that software development is knowledge capture.  The resulting knowledge has to be so thorough and complete that a lump of fused beach sand can perform the required functions. (If you don't think software development is knowledge capture, what else can you possibly describe it as?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Users Lie&lt;/strong&gt;.  (Okay, maybe they assume or make mistakes.)  You can either fight against it or leverage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is only revealed through an exploratory conversation.  People often make mistakes and assumptions without realizing the consequences.  You can document it, but that invests money in capturing the lie – which helps how?  This isn't a political debate where we're playing &amp;quot;spot the flip-flop.&amp;quot;  You need to capture the knowledge as software in a variety of drafts and revisions to reveal the problems.  “It looks good on paper, but…”  It &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt;  looks good on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk accrues&lt;/strong&gt;.  Either tackle it up front in small pieces, or suffer the consequences of being swamped by a large amount of risk later.  Again, you can try to think your way through all the risks, or you can think your way through the biggest risk first.  Which is a better investment: tackle one really hard problem and &lt;strong&gt;solve&lt;/strong&gt;  it, or enumerate all possible problems without solving anything?  I think a solution in hand is worth two problems in the bush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk has two components.  There’s technical risk (do we really know the technology) and application risk (do we really know the application.)  You can control #1 with education; you cannot control #2 under any circumstances.  Why bother &amp;quot;controlling&amp;quot; it?  How about recognize it and manage it through an exploratory conversation and incremental tackling of risk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scope Creep is Not Bad&lt;/strong&gt;.  It's reality (see #2, above).  You can either fight against it or leverage it.  To leverage it, make scope change possible.  In particular, make scope contraction possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools Matter&lt;/strong&gt;.   Use the highest-level tools possible for this “knowledge capture” exercise.  C++ is not a civilized way to build application software.  A few performance-critical pieces, maybe; but whole applications?  Never.  You absolutely need Test-Driven Development and a toolset that supports it.  Java (and JUnit) are minimally acceptable.  Python (and unittest) rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a bunch of education involved in making this case to folks who are habituated to a waterfall methodology.  My suggestion is to start with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://agilemanifesto.org/"&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; .  Move on to customer conversations.  Then pitch a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.controlchaos.com/"&gt;scrum&lt;/a&gt; -based or scrum-like project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="current-work"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just sold a multi-year scrum project by telling the customer that it will take several years of 5 to 8 people a year slugging away at it. We start Monday.  The first few years will have more intensive levels of effort.  After a while the work will subside from the initial development to ongoing maintenance and support.  They'd been building and using the software for 30 years -- we weren't going to replace it in 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I specifically told them that there's no &amp;quot;scope&amp;quot; that they (or we) can properly define in terms a lawyer or accountant could understand.  The software we're renovating is too entrenched, embedded, and deep-seated to cleanly separate as a distinct &amp;quot;system&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;package&amp;quot;.  We will renovate until they tell us to stop.  At that point, we guarantee software that's a better fit to the business, more adaptable, more maintainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't -- up front -- guarantee a finite, definite scope.  We do, however, promise to use all of the time they allocate to the project for customer reviews, priority settings and unit test development.  We can't work on this alone -- it requires deep end-user engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="where-s-the-risk"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where's the Risk?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TC's initial comment was on eliminating what he saw as a huge amount risk in a waterfall methodology. He (correctly) saw that an incremental methodology -- badly applied -- doesn't shift the risk burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where are our risks?  Customer knowledge of the business?  We're building incrementally.  They can lie because it only affects the very next sprint.  Not the whole &amp;quot;project&amp;quot;.   The &amp;quot;customer cooperation&amp;quot; factor is a huge problem in the waterfall methodology.  Here, it's a sprint's worth of problem, little more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge of the technology?  Again, we're tackling things in pieces, we're only looking at one sprint's worth of confusion or problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the &amp;quot;devastating change&amp;quot; that always seems to occur late in the project?  First, that's often because someone said &amp;quot;Hard-Part-Do-Later&amp;quot;.  That's just bad practice.  Second, that's often because of an inflexible, untestable design.  Test-Driven Development and ultra-high-powered tools mitigates this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

An iterative approach is inherently more appealing, but I’m damned if I can see how you can use this approach in [a Firm Fixed Price] environment without a huge amount of contingency/risk money buried in the costing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, some kind of iterative approach that allows us to fine-tune the deliverables is needed.  However, The core objection is the hand-wringing over risk management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to get past our standard going-in position of “The Software we build will be X, the whole X and nothing but X so help us God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can iterate the waterfall approach with smaller waterfalls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can ditch waterfalls, entirely, and try to step outside the box to take an Agile tack on this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's important is this.  There’s no more risk in Agile (or small waterfalls) than there was in the big waterfall.  Each small waterfall is small risk, and it’s spread through the project.  People (specifically, project managers) try to say that iterative approaches have &amp;quot;a huge amount of contingency/risk&amp;quot; because they worry that a later waterfall will have a devastating change an earlier earlier waterfall, leading to a giant wave of unplanned rework.  They’re simply wrong about later phases devastating earlier phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to iterate successfully, you have to start with the hardest part first.  The part that entails the most business or technical risk (or both, if things are really bad.)  By doing the hard part first, the remaining waterfalls will NEVER have as much risk as the ones already past.  And you know early on how you stand regarding business (or technology) problems.  They call this the “Spiral Model”.  You spiral out from the really hard, high risk bits, doing Functional Spec -&amp;gt; Design Doc -&amp;gt; Code/Test -&amp;gt; Release over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes this isn’t very satisfying because it’s still a series of fixed, unthinking waterfalls, in which a lesson learned isn’t an improvement, it’s scope creep.  When lessons learned are considered bad – because they knocked the Fixed out of Firm Fixed Price -- you can’t really be very successful, only marginally better at risk reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="can-we-iterate-without-the-customers-buy-in"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can We Iterate Without the Customer’s Buy-In?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can start doing iterative spiral development any time you want.  You don't need to involve the customer.  To do this, you must rank the business or technology problems from high risk to low risk and focus on the high risk first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's really important to note that you haven’t added any risk dollars by iterating.  Indeed, you’ve probably reduced the practical impact of risk by tackling the worst cases first.  Each solved problem reduces your risk budget, but you never reduce your price.  Each solved problem transfers money from contingency to profit.  Why not start with the hardest problem first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, however, doesn’t really help the customer much.  You’ve just optimized your side of the risk equation without giving them a chance to optimize their side.  Enter the Agile approach.  If you pass the savings on to them, you will probably do even better at this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="agility"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Agility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your initial problem sounds like you’re describing the &lt;strong&gt;Standard Relationship&lt;/strong&gt;: (1) define X, then (2) execute a plan which can only lead to X.  Some like to call this &amp;quot;risk reduction&amp;quot;.  Any deviation from the plan is a &amp;quot;risk&amp;quot; of &amp;quot;slippage&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;scope creep&amp;quot;.  Even meaningful lessons learned – if they alter the scope – are evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, managers don’t understand the functionality or the value.  They only understand cost and schedule.  Since they don’t get the delivered functionality, they can’t manage the delivery of value, they can only manage the calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there’s no way to avoid a rigid linear approach if you’re forced to make a rigid, linear promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Response (chime in with me, if you’ve heard this one before): &amp;quot;But that’s what our customers expect/demand: a rigid promise to build X for $.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really?  Do our customer's really expect this, or is this a cultural bias that our company has?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't our customers really want us to solve problem Y for them?  And aren't they suggesting that software X is a good approach?  A notional approach?  Or are they claiming that they're giving us the absolute, final, non-negotiable approach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile specifically requires that you change the relationship from “Build X or Get Sued” to “Sneak up on solving problem Y through a series of software releases, each of which does something useful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile says that problem Y must be solved.  It further says that software X seems like the solution, for now.  Most importantly, it requires the buyers and the developers have a dialog where the buyers prioritize meaningful, valuable pieces of the problem and the developers commit to something that solves that valuable, meaningful piece of the problem.  No one promises or expects delivery of X, but they do require that we (collectively) solve a piece of problem Y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your customer really does expect/demand “Build X or Get Sued”, then Agility doesn’t interest them.  They’re playing a game with “risk” and you’re not going to get far unless you are allowed to sit down and talk candidly about what’s realistic and how they might be able to sneak up on solving Y without a formal, rigid contract.  You may not get far with this because many, many people don’t see the distinction between Build X and Solve Y.  They have to assume that X is the ONLY solution to Y, otherwise, well, anything could be on the table and that’s just chaos.  Dogs and cats sleeping together.  Dead rising from the grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="firm-fixed-price-is-specifically-anti-agile"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Firm Fixed Price is specifically Anti-Agile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the Horror Story that our management worries about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You pitch developing a solution using Iterative (or even Agile) techniques.  The Customer agrees and allocates full-time end-user resources to solving the problem.  You sit at the whiteboard on day 1 and ask them what’s the biggest, knottiest, most horrible part of the problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They tell you about a MS-Access spreadsheet that’s just crap and makes their lives miserable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait! you say.  &amp;quot;Wasn’t this about fixing the scanning and the shipping and the label printing?&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Well,&amp;quot; they admit, &amp;quot;Sure, that’s nice, too.&amp;quot;  It turns out that the high cost item isn't some slick new functionality, it's their inability to do some high-value, high-visibility business function because they started in MS-Access and it didn't scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you replace the MS-Access database, providing an 80% solution.  Users happy.  Sadly, merely 8 weeks of budget spent.  Hardly any real money involved in this.  Nowhere near your budgetary estimate of 6 people for 8 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, priority two is to fix the various feeds to and from the database.  This COULD involve reworking the scanning and the label printing and the Symbol-brand hand-held scanners.  But, you’ll solve 80% of what’s left with some relatively low-rent data transformations written in Python.   The scanning and printing and Symbol stuff bumps down to priority three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the feeds and reports are fixed, priority three isn’t looking very interesting any more because – uhhh – the database you fixed on step 1 – it’s wrong.  Has always been wrong.  Before, they couldn’t see how wrong it was, but now that you fixed it and got the feeds right… uhhh… this is embarrassing, but, the fundamental business model has a gap in it.  So, could you kindly pack up and go home while they figure out what to do next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was – what? – cancelled?  Successful?  Scope-crept out of existence?  On hold?  What exactly happened there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that it was hugely valuable.  The bad news is that it did not actually deliver the original vision, using the original budget or scope.  Or anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="good-news-bad-news"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good News / Bad News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one wants to be involved in this kind of good news/bad news project.  Bad News always Wins.  This is universally derided as a failure.  Cancellation.  Scope problems.  Poor requirements definition.  Fail.  Fail.  Epic Fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile, however, specifically demands that you look at this as delivery of value (because it was).  You didn’t meet the “original” vision because, frankly, the original vision was junk.  You did identify and make big strides toward solving the actual problem.  And, it turns out, the problem had gnarly, deeply buried root causes, that aren’t amenable to a software solution.  Few things can be better than to uncover serious institutional problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, however, you’re not building software with a firm fixed price and delivery schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="paralyzed-by-the-procurement-process"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paralyzed by the Procurement Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, the procurement process tends to gloss over the problem definition – the users merely think they know, and IT has to pretend that the users actually know.  IT's governance process requires that someone fabricate some financial projection (phrases like “ROI” and “payback period” are prominently featured in the projection.)  [It’s insane because there aren’t a lot of facts backing it up; often none.]  So, IT then writes a “requirements document” full of techno-mumbo-jumbo in which the &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt;  is not well characterized.  The solution, however, is described in glorious detail -- most of it non-functional quality attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You – as vendor – can’t figure out the priorities of any requirements because you can’t see what’s the biggest, costliest, ugliest part of the original problem, and what software features would make a meaningful dent in the costly, ugly part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they want a firm, fixed price, you can’t really have Agile (or even Iterative) conversations, because they can’t adjust their priorities and still have a fixed price.  Further, they may not be able to disentangle the proposed solution, X, from the original business problem, Y.  It’s not that they won’t.  It’s that they aren’t empowered to make trade-off decisions, since tradeoffs would change scope, which changes price which takes “fixed” out of it.  And scope changes, as noted above, are evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-to-do"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What to Do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “fixed price” question is sometimes rather silly.  Often, it’s a question of “I have $$$ to spend, do you think you can solve problem Y?”  So they give you specs for X, you quote a price, it’s too high so they amend the specs for X2 and you circle around.  Or the price is too low, and they're suspicious and don’t award it.  They don’t learn much; neither do you.  They have the price of $$$ in mind, and you have to guess the number they’re thinking of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, some customers are doing legitimate thinking, and just want to know how much they need to allocate.  The problem is real and they’re not just playing risk/cost/budget/schedule games.  However, their procurement policy may still stymie them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to start the Agile conversation is to convince them of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It will take a long time and a lot of money.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can fork it over now as a Firm-Fixed Price payment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Or you can fork it over in pieces.&lt;/strong&gt;   We’ll commit the first piece, only.  After that, you can decide to fork over more, or declare the problem solved.  You only pay for the Next Thing; but you have to actively manage the selection of the Next Thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What about an over-all budget for this so-called-Agile-process?”  [“I won’t hold you to it, I just need a number for next year’s budget.”  Right.  And you’ll still respect me in the morning.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the easy answer:  “What’s it costing you today?” Problem Y costs you $$$ per month?  Base the budget on that.  Throw four months of money at it and we’ll deliver something that will take a big chunk out of the $$$.  The savings will probably fund the remaining phases.  If they don’t, you have an easier decision 16 weeks from now: you'll know know specific, detailed, focused things that worked or didn’t work.  They'll have made a prudent, low-risk investment in information and a partial solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the hard answer:  “How long will you be working on this?”  The team will cost $$$ per month.  Base the budget on that.  The team’s going to be in place for as long as it takes.  12*$$$ per year.  How many years?  Until the customer is satisfied.  Remember, they only budget on a yearly basis, so next year’s 12*$$$ budget is a decision they'll have to make then, not now.  Think of it this way: there are no multi-year projects, just a series of 8-week Agile deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="recommendations"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://agilemanifesto.org/"&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; .   Look closely at the Boehm Spiral Model, for instance in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://safari.oreilly.com/0201729156"&gt;Metrics and Models in Software Quality Engineering&lt;/a&gt; .  Read up on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.controlchaos.com/"&gt;Scrum&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go back to the customer that recognized that we didn't solve their problem and have a frank discussion on an Agile approach.  How would they want us to structure an Agile deal?&lt;/p&gt;

You can make it complicated with any one of a large number of dumb-as-dirt decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Real World&lt;/strong&gt;™, time may be a quantum field (read stuff by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=uPao7ThZEZAC"&gt;'t Hooft&lt;/a&gt; ).  For that matter, space itself may have some quantum granularity.  Or, this could be a handy hack the physicists have devised because it makes the math work out more simply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Relational Databases, the digital representation of time does have a specific resolution.  A quantum of time is the microsecond.  Mostly, but not always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is simple, it's the calendar that's complicated.  [Okay, time may not be that simple, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=lSEXAFwHvcsC"&gt;read here&lt;/a&gt; .]  For our purposes, time is linear and unidirectional, with a 1-microsecond resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gregorian calendar, on the other hand, has two sets of interlocking dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Days - which are just another unit of time: weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Months and Years - which are random boundaries among days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bad-old-days"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bad Old Days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calendar can be made much more complicated by adhering to a 1970's view of data processing -- the view that said things like &amp;quot;this software won't be in use in 2000, don't worry about centuries.&amp;quot;  When I was a child (and thought like a child) we were told, explicitly, to omit century information.  The extra two digits, which were always &amp;quot;19&amp;quot; and were always going to be &amp;quot;19&amp;quot; didn't have any useful information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, we rarely had pleasant, easy-to-use calendrical calculation libraries.  The &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt;  of a book like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Standard-Date-Time-Library-Programming/dp/0879304960"&gt;The Standard C Date/Time Library&lt;/a&gt;  didn't exist.  Rather than refer to great books like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://emr.cs.uiuc.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/index.shtml"&gt;Calendrical Calculations&lt;/a&gt; , we &amp;quot;rolled our own&amp;quot;.  Often with profound bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horror Story.  At one client site, Mike had a yellow sticky note on his workstation to remind him to fix a date calculating routine in 2000.  The bug had surfaced in '92 and they worked around it.  In '96 it had surfaced again.  Rather than write the proper leap year calculation, Mike planned -- with malice aforethought -- to patch the software every four years as long as he worked there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the 21st century.  Using any home-brewed date or calendar library is at least crazy and perhaps criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="useless-data-types"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Useless Data Types&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Bad Old Days&lt;/strong&gt;  lead folks to put some useless data types in the SQL standard.  By useless, I mean absolutely without value.  I consider their use a potential quality defect, and lift it up as a bug every time I encounter them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winner of the &lt;strong&gt;Useless&lt;/strong&gt;  category is Time as a distinct data type.  Time means &amp;quot;Time-of-Day&amp;quot;, and is just the least-significant portion of a proper DateTime.  It is not atomic data except in one very specialized situation.  I'll get back to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Runner-up in the &lt;strong&gt;Useless&lt;/strong&gt;  category is Date as a distinct data type.  Date means &amp;quot;DateTime with time set to midnight&amp;quot; and is just a way of rounding a DateTime down to the nearest Date.  Sometimes, you can make the business case that time didn't matter.  In some instances you truly have a date with no relevant time (examples follow).  More often, you have users who only want to see the Date portion of a full DateTime; this is a matter of formatting, not a matter of intentionally dropping precision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which leaves us with DateTime (a/k/a Timestamp).  This is generally what we mean -- a point in time.  We might display just the date, or the full date and time.  We might omit fractions of seconds, or we might show just hours and minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using any data type other than a full DateTime (or TimeStamp) requires some careful justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="waste-of-storage"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Waste of Storage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been hearing the &amp;quot;waste of storage&amp;quot; malarkey for 30 years.  I'm tired of it.  A full date can be persisted in just 10 bytes.  You only need 4 bytes for a day counter, 3 bytes for a seconds-of-the-day counter (range 0 to 86,400), and 3 bytes for a microsecond counter.   A pleasant DateTime class may have dozens of methods, but not require much persistent real storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That's fine in theory,&amp;quot; they counter, &amp;quot;but we like human readable dates in our files.&amp;quot;  Yes, that does require 20 characters to record yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.ssssss.  In short, some folks prefer to (a) demand a storage wasting format and then (b) complain about the storage their storage-wasting format requires.  Sigh.  We have to truncate a perfectly good DateTime to Date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of storage is falling rapidly.  We can waste serious money analyzing and justifying each date.  Or we just buy storage and move on to more interesting questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-date-round-offs"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Date Round-Offs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we have built-in support for rounding off a DateTime to the nearest date, we rarely have much support for rounding off a DateTime to the nearest month.  I worked an application where manufacturing could only provide month and year of manufacture.  For inexplicable reasons we didn't simply call this a DateTime with a day of 1, and a time of midnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one could figure out how to work with a (&lt;em&gt;year&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;month&lt;/em&gt; ) pair.  When I arrived on the scene numerous interactive pages and reports had been developed which simply did not work correctly except for a tiny test case that involved a single record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly disturbing was their mishandling of the 18-month rolling report which showed a summary of over a year of manufacturing data.  There were if-statements of a complexity that absolutely baffled me.   How could these programmers be clever enough to write that horrible, complex, opaque if-statement and not see the essential simplicity of using a month counter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
monthCount = year*12 + month

year= monthCount // 12
month= monthCount % 12
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's nothing more complex than the above formulas to reduce their hideous, unreadable morass of logic to  a proper &amp;quot;between&amp;quot; clause. [BTW, the project manager balked.  He wanted to deliver on-time, irrespective of readability.  I had to concoct test cases that failed before he would consider their mountain of trash as a problem.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-data-warehouse-round-off"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Data Warehouse Round-Off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data Warehouse applications have to work with the simplest possible GROUP-BY constructs.  [That's one important theme of Kimball's Data Warehouse Toolkit.]  A full DateTime, however, is often too fine-grained for data warehouse use.  Doing calculations to round a DateTime to the nearest Date (or week, or month, or quarter or year) is impractical.  What to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DW trick is to have a &amp;quot;Date&amp;quot; table which enumerates every day under consideration in the data warehouse.  It provides all calendrical attributes for each day, replacing all calculation with simple joins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Don't bother saying &amp;quot;That's too much storage.&amp;quot;  Do the math first: it's not big; if you've got 20,000,000 rows of account facts, 36,524 rows of dates isn't worth discussing. You'll rarely preload a whole century of dates; if you just put in a decade, your chart of accounts will be bigger.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we join to the Date table?  Consistent with other DW technique, you need to break the Third Normal Form rule (&amp;quot;no derived data&amp;quot;) and carry an additional attribute that is derived from your DateTime: the FK reference to your Date table.  This FK reference is based on rounding the DateTime down to the Date only for the purposes of locate the proper Date row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're really strapped for storage, you might can try to separate the Date and Time parts of a DateTime.  Then you'd use both the Date and the Time as a kind of DateTime, or you'd use Date alone.  I don't like this because you orphan the Time portion of the original DateTime; Time is not an atomic attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="date-range-comparisons"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Date Range Comparisons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Date range comparisons are ubiquitous.  In data warehouse applications, they are an essential ingredient to managing a slowly-changing dimension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common situation is to have a table of records that are supposed to fit together providing a seamless coverage through time.  Let's say we're working with something simple like territory changes.  A customer belongs to territory A for some range of dates, then is switched to territory B for another range of dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a Customer to Territory association (sometimes called a bridge table in data warehousing circles.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="25%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="25%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="25%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="25%" /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Customer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Territory&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Starting Date&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ending Date&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3/4/05&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4/5/06 &lt;em&gt;(end A)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4/5/06 &lt;em&gt;(start B)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5/6/07&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5/6/07&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12/31/2199 (&amp;quot;foreseeable future&amp;quot;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is common, and very easy to query incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, look at the dates labeled &lt;em&gt;end A&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;start B&lt;/em&gt;.  We have two choices for ways to encode these date relationships.  In both cases, we're comparing some query date, &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;, for membership in a date range; between the start time, &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and the end time, &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closed Interval&lt;/strong&gt;.  This is the case expressed by SQL BETWEEN: &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;d BETWEEN T_s AND T_e&lt;/tt&gt;.  Some math textbooks might write this &lt;span class="formula"&gt;[&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;.  We can also say &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; ≤ &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  Depending on the quantum resolution of time you're using, this can be pleasant or nasty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Half-Open Interval&lt;/strong&gt;.  This is the case expressed by &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.  Some math textbooks might write this &lt;span class="formula"&gt;[&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, to show that the interval doesn't include one end.  If you simply ban use of BETWEEN, this representation has several advantages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll look at each more closely to provide reasons why Closed Intervals (and the BETWEEN operator) are a problem waiting to happen.  Half-Open Intervals work out better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="closed-interval"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closed Interval&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a Closed Interval requires that the dates marked &lt;em&gt;end A&lt;/em&gt;  and &lt;em&gt;start B&lt;/em&gt;  above are not equal.  If they were equal, then both records would be in the result set for that matching time.  There can, however, be no gap between these two times.  If we use Date data types, then they must differ by exactly one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we use DateTime, then the DateTime value from the end of one range must differ from the end of the next range by the exact time resolution value, 1 microsecond.  Nasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I've had programmers say that 1 second is good enough, and the odds of a time falling into the crack are really low.  What?  We're building something that doesn't pass simple unit tests and we're going say that the odds of failure are &amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot;?]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to insert the next territory change, we need to do two things.  We have to set the end date of the previous territory so it is no longer &amp;quot;the foreseeable future&amp;quot; and instead is the actual end date.  We have to increment that date by 1 microsecond and use that as the start date for the next territory record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="half-open-interval"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Half-Open Interval&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Half-Open Interval requires that the dates marked end A and start B above are simply equal.  We're going to simply forbid the use of BETWEEN and force everyone to write Ts &amp;amp;lt;= d AND d &amp;amp;lt; Te.  Time quanta don't enter into this, since the end of one range is the same Date or DateTime value as the beginning of the next range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is much simpler; trivially proven to be absolutely reliable and correct.  All we have to do is forbid the use of BETWEEN for dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been told this will be confusing to &amp;quot;other users&amp;quot; of the database.  For this, I have one question: &amp;quot;Who specifically?&amp;quot;  We can write them a memo.  I've been told that removing BETWEEN is too onerous a burden on the developers.  Again, I have one question, &amp;quot;Who specifically?&amp;quot;  I'll work with them as long as it takes to show them the alternative formulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The knottiest problem is &amp;quot;What about end-user queries?&amp;quot;  I'm a-waffle on this.  I don't think end-users should be afflicted with SQL.  However, if we tie up all reporting in an inefficient IT department, end-users will immediately take active steps to write their own queries.  If we aim high and provide everyone a license to a reporting tool like Business Objects, then the date ranges are hidden in the BO universe definitions.  If we can't afford that... well, &lt;strong&gt;Bad Things&lt;/strong&gt;  are pretty much inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either get proper reporting tools or provide enough education so that end users are actually coached through using the data model correctly.  A few hours of coaching beats flawed software and endless troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pure-dates"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pure Dates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some business rules are based on a date, and the time isn't available.  These rules are universally situations where humans must supply a date.  When the system itself supplies a date, it's always a portion of a DateTime.  When humans are asked to supply a date, they are not able to provide a full DateTime.  Examples include all of the standard life milestone events like birth date, marriage date, employment start and end dates, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="unbound-times"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unbound Times&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's one potential use for Time, separated from DateTime.  That's when we're defining a scheduling rule.  In this very rare case, we have a time of day that is not bound to a specific date.  That's the only instance where a Time is an atomic piece of data.  In all other cases, Time is just the least significant part of DateTime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is simple.  Use DateTime.  Format DateTime values to show only the date portion if that's what users want.  Use Half-Open Intervals, and don't use BETWEEN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question was a good one because it involved the classic higher-order database relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The canonical SQL relationships are binary equi-join relationships that can be implemented with simple foreign keys.  An example design is a Group and the Members of the group is the most common example because it is a nice 1 Group to many Members relationship.  All of the Members have foreign keys that refer to the Group to which they belong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A SQL many-to-many relationship is binary, but doesn't work out as trivially.  In this specific case, we're scheduling events for specific groups.  An event has many groups, a group participates in many events.  Clearly, a single foreign key isn't going to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard SQL hack is to have a many-to-many association table that links events and groups.  The association is a collection of foreign-key pairs.  Each foreign key, however, participates in a simple binary relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="wrong-way-to-the-next-level"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrong Way To The Next Level&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we start talking about groups of people, participating in events, at specific times and places, we have higher-order relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that actually appears as a valid schedule entry has at least four independent dimensions.  We have one or more groups, one time, one place, and one &amp;quot;activity&amp;quot; (lecture, lab, workshop, field trip, whatever.)  This isn't a binary relationship, it's a fourth-order relationship.  It will be higher when you also track individual people (like instructors) in addition to groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you start looking at this as a bunch of binary many-to-many relationships, you can easily get yourself into a &lt;strong&gt;Rat-Warren of Design Details&lt;/strong&gt;™.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of associations in the email included ActivityToGroup, ActivityToPlace, ActivityToTime, GroupToPlace, GroupToTime, etc.  In essence they had enumerated all possible pairs from the underlying 4th order relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the architect had identified all of those binary relationships, they wanted to refactor all of them into a single Uber-Meta-Association class.  Django imposes a number of restrictions, which seemed onerous.  Even SQL's foreign keys imposed too many restrictions.  Python's duck typing didn't seem flexible enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-attractive-nuisance"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Attractive Nuisance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many attractive nuisance features of Python and Django.  Duck Typing -- for example -- can burn up a lot of brain calories.  You begin to think of a class to define an association between objects.  A class to define the attributes of objects.  Wait, what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My suggestion was to rethink all those pair-wise foreign key relationships.  Most of them, in isolation, are meaningless because they aren't unique.  Yes, Group X participates in Activity 101.  in 3 locations at 3 separate schedules.  Almost all the many-to-manys are just a subset of one fourth-order relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, flexibility is possible.  However, Python already provides the Uber-Meta-Association; that's what Duck Typing IS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In SQL, you could collapse a lot of binary many-to-many relationships into a generic many-to-many table.  Django wouldn't like this because Django likes more structure in the database.  To make sense of the uber-meta association table, you'd need to know which &amp;quot;base&amp;quot; tables were connected on each side of the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait.  Wouldn't that base table identification be a kind of type declaration?  Can't you just to that in Django directly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="my-advice"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Advice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1, lay off the coffee.  Too much thinking about creating generic generalizations of abstractions doesn't build useful software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2, use higher-order associative relationships.  4th or 5th order relationships work beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 3, build something small that works.  Get the test cases right.  Get data loaded.  It's relatively easy (in Django) to spin up a new app that is derived from an old app but adds new features.  You convert that data, switch the urls.py file and you're up and running with new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the model I proposed which eliminated all of the many-to-many relationships, replacing them with a single, higher-order relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="EventModel.png" src="https://slott56.github.io/media/EventModel.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't over-solve the problem you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've already made your application &amp;quot;future-proof&amp;quot;.  Further design effort to make this even more general isn't going to be too helpful.  You've already done the right thing by choosing high-powered tools like Python and Django that make it easy to implement a new architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

We have a table of events or rules or policies that have start dates.  Some have end dates, because they've been replaced or superseded.  Others don't have end-dates because they apply for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There aren't too many variations on the open-ended date range problem.  We have a table of events or rules or policies that have start dates.  Some have end dates, because they've been replaced or superseded.  Others don't have end-dates because they apply for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of date ranges here: close-ended and open-ended.  The close-ended date ranges have a start and a duration (or a start and an end).  The open-ended date ranges have a start and no end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two design patterns for the open-ended ranges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use the SQL Domain-Independent NULL.  In this case we'll have queries like :x BETWEEN tbl.start AND COALESCE( tbl.end, :x ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can define a Domain-Specific NULL for the end dates.  A date in the far, far future works best.  In this case, we'll have queries like :x BETWEEN tbl.start AND tbl.end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="opinions-vary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Opinions Vary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One manager was pretty sure that the NULL case would be faster.  I'm not sure why, but I need to ask when I'm out there next.  I think this was based on the observation that tables with lots of NULL columns process faster.  (For full table scans, this is true because the table is physically smaller.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was darn sure that the NULL's would be measurably slower.  Why?  They can't be indexed.  Since they're not in the index, the RDBMS has to resort to full table scans and can't exploit the index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boy was I wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've only tested a few databases, but my results make a lot of sense.  Indexes help the database optimize some kinds of queries, particularly &amp;quot;==&amp;quot; tests and equijoins between tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these &amp;quot;in a range&amp;quot; queries, the RDBMS's I looked at don't appear to leverage the index in terribly clever ways.  They appear to use full table scans.  I'm not really terribly surprised.  Query optimization is hard enough, cleverly using an index for &amp;quot;in a range&amp;quot; would probably be too much thinking for a fairly rare kind of query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RDBMS performance measurement is hard.  Many things interfere with getting solid performance numbers.  The best approach is long-term averages under load.  So, some of my results may have a great deal of experimental bias built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what I did see were microscopic differences between the two approaches to open-ended date ranges.  I saw colossal differences between table scans and joins with and without indexes.  I saw colossal differences with different kinds of indexes.  But the two end-date representations seemed equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="my-trump-card"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Trump Card&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got some follow-up comments on my &amp;quot;non-null NULL&amp;quot; approach.  I think they mean &amp;quot;domain-specific&amp;quot; nulls, that is, using a large date instead of a NULL.  That shows a bias where they're equating open-ended dates with NULLs.  As if the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; implementation were NULLs and I'm proposing something radical and odd with my &amp;quot;non-null NULL&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They worry about documenting the domain-specific NULL.  How do we explain that this &amp;quot;random date in the far future&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;till the end of time as we know it&amp;quot;?  I think they're just hand-wringing because they don't want to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They act like the established meaning for NULL is &amp;quot;for the foreseeable future&amp;quot;.  Sadly, that's not true; NULL can mean almost anything.  Sometimes it might mean &amp;quot;don't know&amp;quot;.  Sometimes it mean &amp;quot;does not apply&amp;quot;.  Sometimes it means &amp;quot;the input was incomplete, and we'll update this later.&amp;quot;  Sometimes it means, &amp;quot;the input was incomplete, and this record is a place-holder to remind us to fix the error.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a lot of other people's code.  While you may be pretty solid on your &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; use of :x BETWEEN start and COALESCE ( end, :x ), you're in the minority on this.  What I observe about SQL idioms is that one programmer does it that way, and all the other programmers do it other ways.  The stored procedure hack will write define a whole library of procedures to &amp;quot;make the problem go away.&amp;quot;  At least one maintenance programmers won't get the idiom, and will write application program loops with IF statements.  Further, what I often have to analyze is the one mystery program with SQL so obscure that no one dares touch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A COALESCE isn't obscure&amp;quot; you say.  My response is, &amp;quot;if that was the only problem, I'd agree.  But you've got so many other things going on, that it would be good to have just this date thing be simple and obvious.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bottom-line"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance-wise, I couldn't prove that NULLs or far future dates are better.  Reading-wise, I prefer to read simpler code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, simple wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="technical-note"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technical Note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I used Python to build the SQL and execute it with various kinds of data.  It was handy to collect the results in CSV file and pump it straight into the spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different RDBMS products have different syntax for these date things, so I had to do a bunch of relatively icky text manipulation.  I wanted to use SQLAlchemy to handle the vagaries of the database engines, but the client would have disputed the results.  Instead I had to build relatively simple Python to run plain-old-SQL in simple, obvious ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

There's a Perl program on CPAN to do &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://search.cpan.org/~prasad/X12-0.08/lib/X12/Parser.pm"&gt;X12 parsing&lt;/a&gt; ; the program itself isn't useful, but the X12 messages are defined via INI files.  There's also a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pyx12.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Python X12&lt;/a&gt;  parser with the X12 messages defined via XML files.  I don't really like working with the INI or XML definitions because the INI or XML merely defines a Python object that does the real work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My idea was to replace the configuration files in these two examples.  It it clearly better to build a Python object that actually is the X12 parser rather than read a bunch of files which build the Python.  This Python parser definition can be build with relative ease from the the X12 standards coupled with a business partner's Implementation Guide (IG).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on partner IG's and two sets of helpful examples of config files, I built the necessary set of classes.  Then I built an example X12 message parser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the problem: it was too big.   Python died.  (Well... not &lt;em&gt;dead&lt;/em&gt;, but it threw an exception that said that the Python parser had run out of memory.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't reckon on how big an X12 message definition actually is.  I was shocked -- shocked -- that an object construction would be a problem.  I was already to start dashing off angry messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I looked closely at my example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a single object construction expression that covered over 1200 lines.  It created about 774 or so distinct objects.  It appears that a single expression of this scale is a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like this (but is 1200 lines long).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
parse278= Message( &amp;quot;278&amp;quot;, Properties(...),
    Loop( &amp;quot;ISA_LOOP&amp;quot;, Properties(...),
        Segment( &amp;quot;ISA&amp;quot;, Properties(...),
           Element( &amp;quot;ISA01&amp;quot;, ... ),
           Element( &amp;quot;ISA02&amp;quot;, ... ),
           ...14 more...
        ),
        Loop( &amp;quot;GS_LOOP&amp;quot;, Properties(...), ...long, long list... ),
        Loop( &amp;quot;GE_LOOP&amp;quot;, Properties(...), ... ),
        Segment( &amp;quot;IEA&amp;quot;, Properties(...),
            Element( &amp;quot;IEA01&amp;quot;, ... ),
            Element( &amp;quot;IEA02&amp;quot;, ... ),
        ),
    )
)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single, 1200-line statement doesn't actually compile.  After I thought about it, I realized I was asking a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that changing this massive expression into a series of discrete assignment statements requires relatively little real work.  And the X12 message structure (based on nested Loops) encourages the definition of the overall message as a series of Loop objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
ST_LOOP = Loop( ... )
GS_LOOP = Loop( u'GS_LOOP', Properties(...),
  Segment( 'GS'...),
  ST_LOOP,
  Segment( 'GE'... ), )
ISA_LOOP = Loop( u'ISA_LOOP', Properties(...),
  Segment( u'ISA', Properties(...),
    Element( u'ISA01', ...),
    ...
  )
  GS_LOOP,
  Segment( u'IEA', Properties(...),
  Element( u'IEA01', ... ),
  Element( u'IEA02', ... ),
  ),
)
x278_res = Message( u'278', Properties(...), ISA_LOOP
)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="persistence"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Persistence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond marshalling and unmarshalling, we also need to look at persisting messages.  We can choose to store individual Segments (a bad idea) or the higher-level Loops of Segments (a slightly better idea).  The Loop-based structure of our parser configuration leads to creating a Loop-based data model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important that the SQL model and the Parser structure are completely isomorphic.  We need to take a block of text, unmarshal the message, map it to tables, and load it into a database.  And we need the whole to be driven by a Python configuration which comes from the Implementation Guides in an obvious way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, I need to transform an Implementation Guide into a Python configuration, confident that we can accept, parse, and persist X12 messages in spite of multiple business partners and evolution of the X12 model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since X12 isn't an open standard, this isn't easy.  But Python's flexibility makes it work out well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The problem stems from a need to describe a really complex and extensible structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to describe X12N messages, which have a rather complex structure, and the structure can be customized.  While the core syntax is pretty simple, you need your business partner's Implementation Guide (IG) to make sense of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most IG's are a big table-like document, but aren't properly distributed as a tidy, easy-to-work with table.  [BTW, The documents are usually published as PDF files for two reasons.  One, lawyers understand a file that is hard to edit and don't understand an MD5 digest to show tampering.  Second, X12 parsing seems to be considered a proprietary feature of an application.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="open-source-x12-parsers"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open-Source X12 Parsers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2008_01_12-python_as_config_language_forget_xml_and_ini_files.html"&gt;Python as Config Language -- Forget XML and INI Files&lt;/a&gt;
I mentioned my quest for X12 parsers.  The embarrassing part was that I totally missed one.   On my own, I found a Perl program on CPAN to do &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://search.cpan.org/~prasad/X12-0.08/lib/X12/Parser.pm"&gt;X12 parsing&lt;/a&gt; .  The program itself isn't useful, but the configuration files are basically a summary of an IG.  As INI files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one of my co-workers asked if I'd seen the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pyx12.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Python X12&lt;/a&gt;  parser.  I'm a Python bigot, and totally missed this.  [Thanks, Vinny.]  As with the Perl example, the parsing code isn't terribly useful, since it is too complex.  However, the configuration files are a very useful unwinding of an IG.  As XML files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-more-useful-configuration"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A More Useful Configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The INI-file version of the IG makes some potentially invalid assumptions about message structure.  Specifically, each X12 Loop is defined as starting with a series of Segments and ending with a series of Loops.  Nesting -- in the form of header Segments, Loops and trailer Segments -- isn't tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The XML-file version of the IG -- while more descriptive -- creates a needless level of indirection.  First, we have to build a usable Python structure from the XML.  Then, we use that Python structure to parse the messages.  Further, we have to do this two-pass parsing for each batch of messages we're going to process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure is readily defined by a few Python classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
class Parser( object ):
    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Superclass for all parsing components.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
class Element( Parser ):
    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;A single Element within a Segment.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
class Composite( Element ):
    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;A composite Element within a Segment contains Elements.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
class Segment( Parser ):
    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;A collection of Elements and Composites.
class Loop( Parser ):
    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;A collection of Segments and Loops.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
class Message( Loop ):
    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;A collection of Loops.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this structure, we can define messages in a relatively pleasant way.  Except for a Python syntax rule that leads to a small bit of ickyness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-structural-declaration-pattern"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Structural Declaration Pattern&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;strong&gt;Structural Declaration&lt;/strong&gt;  that I settled on.  This can be built from the Perl .CF files or the Python X12 XML files.  Then it can be customized to match the business partner's Implementation Guide.  [Ideally, it would be build directly from an IG; where the IG is based on a usable spreadsheet -- hopefully in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://xml.openoffice.org/"&gt;Open Office XML&lt;/a&gt; .  Often, Micro$oft Office files can be saved in an open format.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example only names the various Segments without providing the Element-by-Element definitions.  That gets rather long, and isn't always necessary.  Even so, the full 278 message is about 120 lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
x278 = Message(
    &amp;quot;278&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Referral Request/Response&amp;quot;,
    Loop( &amp;quot;ISA&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ISA&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;R&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;,
        Segment(&amp;quot;ISA&amp;quot;),
        Loop( &amp;quot;GS&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;GS&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;R&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;,
            Segment(&amp;quot;GS&amp;quot;),
            Loop( &amp;quot;ST&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;ST&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;R&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;,
                Segment(&amp;quot;ST&amp;quot;,(1,&amp;quot;278&amp;quot;),&amp;quot;Transaction Set Header&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;R&amp;quot;,1),
                Segment(&amp;quot;BHT&amp;quot;,None,&amp;quot;Beginning of Hierarchical Transaction&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;R&amp;quot;,1),
                loop2000A, loop2000B, loop2000C, loop2000D, loop2000E, loop2000F,
            ),
            Loop( &amp;quot;SE&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;SE&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;R&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;,
                Segment(&amp;quot;SE&amp;quot;)
            ),
        ),
        Loop( &amp;quot;GE&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;GE&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;R&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;,
            Segment(&amp;quot;GE&amp;quot;)
        )
    ),
    Loop( &amp;quot;IEA&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;IEA&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;R&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;,
        Segment(&amp;quot;IEA&amp;quot;)
    ),
)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the loop2000x variables is a moderately complex Loop definition.  Ultimately, these will become database tables, but that's another complicated piece of design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is much more expressive than the .INI files.  It is also considerably easier to read and work with than the XML files.  As cool as it is, this isn't &lt;em&gt;precisely&lt;/em&gt;  what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="evolving-of-the-api"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Evolving of the API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look at the resulting parser description -- even for a Segment-level overview of a simple 278 message -- we have some obscurities that crop up.  In particular, we have some evolution management problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, each Loop and Segment has both descriptive information and a complex structure. This extra information include a description, required/situational flags, repeat limits, and any helpful information required to disentangle the Loop structure from a message that is just a flat sequence of Segments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we can't easily evolve our meta-metadata model.  If we want to add parameters to Loop or Segment, we run the risk of invalidating all message parsers previously built and manually tweaked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have two opposing forces.  I want a simple declaration but I also want extensibility.  The simplest declaration is a flat list of parameters.  It has the form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
def __init__( self, name, *loops ):
        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Build a structure of sub-elements.
        &amp;#64;param name: Name of this Message, Loop or Segment
        &amp;#64;param loops: Loop and Segments that belong to this Loop (or Message).
        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
        self.name= name
        self.structure= []
        self.occurance= None # distinguish repeated Segment types
        self.parent= None
        for loop_seg in loops:
            self.append( loop_seg )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has the advantage that we can simply contain all the subordinate structure within a Loop or Segment definition.  The syntax melts away to simple commas.  This is very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suffers from the disadvantage that we can't easily handle an evolving puddle of attributes.  To have a completely flexible definition, we'd really like to use keyword parameters for the additional descriptive information.  Using keywords leaves us the flexibility to add or change the parameters without breaking an installed base of parsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to say something like the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loop( &amp;quot;2000A&amp;quot;, desc=&amp;quot;Some Desc&amp;quot;, required=&amp;quot;S&amp;quot;, repeat=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;, Segment(...), Segment(...), Loop(...), ... )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Python can't parse this, since the keywords are in front of the positional parameters.  Darn it.  I'm forced to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a couple of choices.  First, I could bundle the structural elements into a sequence.  This would lead to an &amp;quot;extra&amp;quot; set of parenthesis or brackets.  Cconsidering that the matching ()'s will be separated by 100's of lines of code, we can't be expected to manage this without errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-properties-bundle"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Properties Bundle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative is to bundle the descriptive parameters into some kind of Properties or Description object which simply carries the extra attributes in a tidy, easy-to-extend object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads us to change the style to something that could be called a &lt;strong&gt;Bundled Properties&lt;/strong&gt;  design.  [Something I first saw in Django.]  This means that our constructor has just two positional parameters followed by an unlimited number of structural elements.  We can live with two positional parameters; it is unlikely to turn into a maintenance problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loop( &amp;quot;2000A&amp;quot;, Properties( desc=&amp;quot;Some Desc&amp;quot;, required=&amp;quot;S&amp;quot;, repeat=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; ), Segment(...), Segment(...), Loop(...), ... )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is much more manageable.  But -- to an extent -- it feels like a workaround for a Python syntax rule.  Actually, it's a more extensible design, since it separates the structure from the non-structural properties of a construct.  We can now update the Properties class definition to add as many properties as we find are necessary to process X12 messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Properties class can be as simple as the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; class Properties( object ):
...     def __init__( self, **kw ):
...         self.__dict__.update( kw )
...
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; p= Properties( hi=&amp;quot;mom&amp;quot;, num=22, denom=7 )
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; p.hi
'mom'
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; p.num
22
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lets us refer to properties with simple names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A programming language has all the advantages as a language for encoding parameters.  I see why it's rare -- too many programmers have spent too much time with MS's abominable INI files and think it's &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I started working on reverse engineering an venerable C program that relied on a set of INI-like files.  It isn't cost-effective to write (or even download) an INI-file parser for Java.  Instead, most of the configuration parameters could be simply moved into a garden-variety Java properties file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some parameters, however, didn't fit the INI format well.  I'd almost completely eliminated any need for the INI file parser until these additional, complex parameters surfaced.  It was a head-scratcher until I reframed the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-would-i-do-this-in-python"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Would I Do This In Python?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python, I could -- trivially -- declare the relationships as a bunch of class constructors.  The simple elegance of the Python constructors lead me to a version in Java that was -- while not as nice -- a lot better than writing Yet Another Parameter File Parser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The INI syntax was -- to an extent -- close enough to a Python (or Java) class constructor that I could transliterate the original INI file into application source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business rules in the config file looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rule_AP = 2, AP, DCO, EXACT, FULL, PAIR, OPENHELD, ALLOW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rewrote them to look like this in Java:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;new Rule_AP( 2, AP, DCO, EXACT, FULL, PAIR, OPENHELD, ALLOW ),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I transformed an ad-hoc INI syntax into first-class Java syntax.  This eliminates a thousand or so lines of useless code.  It also reduces the complexity of the required documentation.  Rather than explain the syntax rules for the INI construct, we simply have to explain what this class does and what the constants mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, we don't have to dwell on the business rule translation from the old format to the new format.  They're essential the same.  The look nearly identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="really-complex-configuration"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Really Complex Configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today I was looking at the problem of parsing &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wmbhelp/v6r0m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/ad09580_.htm"&gt;X12 messages&lt;/a&gt; .  It's a pain in the neck because you need a ton of ancillary information to make sense of the X12 segments and the X12 Loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an hour of poking around, I found a Perl program on CPAN to do &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://search.cpan.org/~prasad/X12-0.08/lib/X12/Parser.pm"&gt;X12 parsing&lt;/a&gt; .  The perl code is of no value.  However, the configuration files -- which describe some of the X12 messages I need to work with -- were very handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they were in a home-brewed INI-like format.  A format that was just enough &lt;em&gt;UN&lt;/em&gt; like INI files that ConfigParser choked on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending a day on the problem, I slowly evolved a configuration that was palatable.  The X12 message descriptions look something like this.  (&lt;em&gt;Warning&lt;/em&gt;: elision, syntax errors may sneak in.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
isa= Loop( &amp;quot;ISA&amp;quot;,
    Segment(&amp;quot;ISA&amp;quot;),
    Loop( &amp;quot;GS&amp;quot;,
      Segment(&amp;quot;GS&amp;quot;),
      Loop( &amp;quot;ST&amp;quot;,
          Segment( &amp;quot;ST&amp;quot;, (1,&amp;quot;278&amp;quot;), Required, 1 ),
          Segment( &amp;quot;BHT&amp;quot;, None , Required, 1 ),
          ...
          ),
      Loop( &amp;quot;SE&amp;quot;,
         Segment (&amp;quot;SE&amp;quot; ),
         ),
      ),
      Loop( &amp;quot;GE&amp;quot;, Segment (&amp;quot;GE&amp;quot; )
  )
iea = Loop( &amp;quot;IEA&amp;quot;, Segment( &amp;quot;IEA&amp;quot; ) )
x278 = Message( isa, iea )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration constructors actually build a recognizer that attempts to match the received message structure with the various parts of the configuration.  It wasn't easy, but when I was done, I could translate the configurations provided in the CPAN X12 package into proper Python object constructors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the outer realms of X12 messages, the Loops only have a single Segment.  The inner portions of the message (all of the Loop2000's, for example) have a much interesting structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="one-syntax"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One Syntax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than cob up a syntax that is based on INI file syntax, I prefer to just use Python.  And rather than parse XML, I prefer to execute the Python directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll post a more complete example in the not-too-distant future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I'd seen some notes in SD Times on a similar theme, and blogged that in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2007_12_07-not_quite_following_the_book.html"&gt;Not Quite Following the Book&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambler's point seems to be the same as Coplien's: &amp;quot;High-level architecture sketches created during your Iteration 0 envisioning activities help set your initial technical direction—a little bit of up front design work helps to avoid structural problems cropping up later in the lifecycle.&amp;quot;  It isn't very efficient to use the fine-grained approach of &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; TDD to get to a good architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's certainly possible to simply work from the ground up, using testing and refactoring to arrive at a good architecture.  Many people have done this on smaller projects.  I think that this exact experience -- refactoring the presence of reasonably complete test cases -- is what sells TDD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's clearly smarter to pitch an architecture early on and get everyone to internalize that architecture.  Each piece of functionality is born with a bias toward fitting into some architecture.  It's best to fit into a common architecture.  Devastating change is reduced (not prevented, but reduced.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus!  People seem to prefer to do it this way.  I'm absolutely sure that they understand the &lt;strong&gt;Agile Theory&lt;/strong&gt;:  anything can be accomplished by working from the details up.   I'm also absolutely sure that they've adapted this foundational theory into a process that reflects practical considerations of the composition of the team and the schedule for delivery of working software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-reasonably-agile-lifecycle"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Reasonably Agile Lifecycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purely Agile TDD is based on a series of practices that will -- eventually -- yield great software.  We can, however, impose some additional practices that will reduce the value of &amp;quot;eventually&amp;quot; to something a little more palatable.  These practices seem to be the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consolidated Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;While disjoint use cases can be knit into a cohesive whole, it's good to review and reconcile the use cases.  I suggest that an analysis model be built to capture the essential nouns and verbs in the use cases.  I need to emphasize &amp;quot;essential&amp;quot;: don't model everything; model the recurring themes, central concepts, and essential ingredients.  This model is NOT (emphasize NOT) a &amp;quot;deliverable&amp;quot; in the sense that code and test cases are deliverable.  This isn't a milestone; if it was, we wouldn't be Agile.  This is merely a tool to help us frame up each use case into a context.  This captures the domain knowledge that users assume and we have to gain.  This consolidated analysis model &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt;  how we gain domain knowledge.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Architectural Overview&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;While we can refactor our way into a decent architecture, this isn't an optimal use of anyone's time.  If the app is web-based, we -- generally -- embrace some framework before we even get started.  We rarely just start coding and hope that a web app appears.  The architecture is NOT a deliverable; it's a context into which each delivery will fit.  Again, this can't be a milestone, since building this becomes a distracting, limited-value project milestone.  The point isn't the architecture, it's the conversation about the architecture, and the impact that conversation has on subsequent work.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acceptance Testing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Different from the detailed testing of TDD, we have the end-user's overall acceptance tests.  This is best viewed as a formal, audited, &amp;quot;for the record&amp;quot; rubber-stamping of the application.  It's very formal, since everyone is forced to look at it; we use formality as a way to provide enough background that a diverse audience can get what they're seeing.  An acceptance test isn't a sing-along around the campfire; it's high opera with a libretto and a closed hall and perhaps a brief intermission lecture by a Famous Artist.  It's audited by QA with an official certification that the software is suitable for production use.  It's &amp;quot;for the record&amp;quot; because everyone is notified about the results, even if they didn't actually attend the show.  QA must write the review for the morning papers to describe how the performance went.  And it's just a rubber stamp of testing that was done at a lower level.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acceptance testing is important because users may not articulate their requirements very well.  Further, developers may not understand the requirements very well.  The Agile approach of a conversation can get bogged down in nuance (or evasion).  A final acceptance test can be a way to manage and focus the conversation.  It doesn't replace the conversation with &amp;quot;a deliverable&amp;quot;, it just directs it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't perfectly Agile.  It involves pre-work that isn't simply a conversation with a user and development of a feature.  It involves elaborate post-work that isn't simply a release into production.  It is somewhat more efficient because time is taken up front to assure everyone agrees and understands the direction.  It is also somewhat more manageable because we have a final performance that belongs more to QA (and the critics) than the users or developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Here's the part RL liked: &amp;quot;Now, if the spec does define everything about how the program is going to behave, then, lo and behold, it contains all the information necessary to generate the program!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RL sent me this link, and tried to create a &amp;quot;perpetual motion&amp;quot; metaphor for Joel's comments.  The thermodynamics parallel seems to stem from thinking that a suitable spec must be of the same level of detail and sophistication as the resulting program.  Joel certainly makes it seem that way with his horror story of an all-day affair to prove simple assertions about simple assignment statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is essentially a &amp;quot;formal methods can't work -- it's logically impossible to use logic&amp;quot; argument.  In Joel's case, there are two points.  First, since you need to both know and prove everything about a program, the formal post-condition is so complex that it essentially &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;  the program.  His other argument is that the proof is just as likely to contain errors as the resulting program.  Compounding this, RL has an inappropriate metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="complexity-and-abstraction"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Complexity and Abstraction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, Joel's position on complexity is false.  In some special cases, it might be true.  But those are special cases where you have no trustworthy (proven) compiler, no trustworthy (proven) libraries, and no previous results on which we can rely.  This is often true in an academic setting, but it is far from true in the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a practical matter we have two ways to use formal methods that make practical, useful sense.  Fundamentally, these are simply abstraction techniques; we apply one to the specification and one to our languages, libraries and tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Joel's point on &amp;quot;everything about how the program is supposed to behave&amp;quot; is misleading.  We don't -- ever -- write down &amp;quot;everything&amp;quot;.  If we did, we'd have specifications that explain digital logic, power distribution, memory access, sequential programming, interrupt management, direct memory access input/output devices, and how a simple integrated circuit can flip on and off a billion times each second.  Think of having to specify how data is encoded on the surface of a disk, just to be sure &amp;quot;everything&amp;quot; was in the specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Joel's &amp;quot;everything&amp;quot; doesn't really mean &amp;quot;everything&amp;quot;.  He seems to mean &amp;quot;everything relevant at the level of abstraction at which I'm proving things.&amp;quot;  The problem arises with the mismatch in abstraction between his proof technique and the problems he wants to solve.  This arises partly from textbook examples that are necessarily simple enough to make sense.  These don't scale in an obvious way to a large, complex program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read Dijkstra (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Discipline-Programming-Prentice-Hall-Automatic-Computation/dp/013215871X"&gt;A Discipline of Programming&lt;/a&gt; ) and Gries (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Science-Programming-Monographs-Computer/dp/0387964800/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b"&gt;The Science of Programming&lt;/a&gt; ).  These were life-altering books for me.  Gries, in particular, provides a wonderful text-book approach that builds a thorough foundation in logic, propositions and proof techniques before diving into a simple language, and ways to develop programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some exercises which hit on the &amp;quot;prior results&amp;quot; issue as a subtext.  For example, one exercise in Gries asks you to prove that swapping two elements of an array leaves the rest of the array intact.  This is -- to an extent -- a duh proposition.  &amp;quot;Of course swapping two elements leaves the array intact,&amp;quot; is the standard response.  However, what's the &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt;  of that glib assertion?  Once you have this, you don't ever need to prove it again.  Indeed, you can -- without too many problems -- omit this trivial detail from a post-condition.  In short, your prior results serve to abstract details away from the real problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="in-the-real-world"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In The Real World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examples in Gries and Dijkstra are pleasantly focused, bounded, and -- in some cases -- intentionally gnarly.  Real world problems tend to be vague, sprawly and rarely have gnarly parts.  For example, if we're matching financial documents (invoices with receipts) we have some common attributes, and some &amp;quot;business rules&amp;quot; that allow customers to partially pay, overpay, split invoices or combine invoices.  There's nothing gnarly about this.  Mostly, there's just vagueness and odd special cases, exceptions, and unstated assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proof techniques are appropriate for the complex nested loops of this application.  Partitioning the input into &amp;quot;batches&amp;quot; of documents which are likely to be related is an algorithm with a fairly easy to define post-condition, and a relatively low level of gnarl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;span class="textbf"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; comparison of documents within a batch of likely matches, similarly, has a relatively simple post-condition, and a moderate level of gnarl.  It's the insertion of all the special cases that becomes tedious.  Except, of course, for abstraction.  All the special cases are subclass of a common &amp;quot;Condition&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;DocCombo&amp;quot; superclass.  We have to prove that our abstract superclasses have the right properties.  Once we have that, we simply prove that each subclass satisfies the superclass assertions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did we specify &amp;quot;everything?&amp;quot;  Actually, no.  We omitted specifying the OS, the RDBMS, or the JVM.  We omitted specifying how the logger works; we just used it, with a blind level of trust that it was reasonably rigorously proven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, did we specify &amp;quot;everything at this level of abstraction?&amp;quot;  Again, no.  We specified the core algorithms for batching and matching.  The post-processing involves an API call that has a loop through the batch.  Does this loop require a full, formal proof?  Or can we inspect it, determine that it fits a proven template, and leave it at that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="buggy-proofs-replace-buggy-programs"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buggy Proofs Replace Buggy Programs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep.  Can't argue with the argument that a buggy proof is the same as a buggy program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the clincher.  You don't have tools for testing or validating your proof: you can't easily find &amp;quot;bugs&amp;quot; in your proof.  Instead, you have to rely on manual inspection of the proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[&lt;em&gt;Irony&lt;/em&gt;] Yep.  That makes the whole technique completely worthless.  How stupid of me to be mislead by charlatans like Gries or Dijkstra. [&lt;em&gt;End Irony&lt;/em&gt; ]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than lying in wait to attack the technique, we can ask what -- if any -- practical value a proof might create.  Of course, it's easier to indict than it is to consider what value lies hidden with the weakest precondition predicate transformer.  What value is created by attempting a proof?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, defining a post-condition, and trying to write a formal assertion, is perhaps the single most valuable step that can ever be performed.  If you can't define &amp;quot;done&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;success&amp;quot;, you know something important.  Without a definition of done, you know that you'll never finish writing your program.  Without a definition of done, someone will always be able to say &amp;quot;It doesn't do [X]&amp;quot; and you can't prove whether it does or doesn't do [X].  Worse, you probably can't say if [X] is in scope or out of scope.  Worse still, you may not be able to define [X] clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, a proof is developed side-by-side with the program.  Joel's example of trying to prove something about a program is specious.  The more productive approach is to locate a statement that has the right post condition, and who's weakest precondition is something that you stand a reasonable chance of implementing.  Then you -- recursively -- start to prove that precondition by locating a statement and it's precondition.  The net is that a buggy proof will grow in parallel with the buggy program.  A tiny bit of test engineering will reveal the program bug -- and the proof bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, a proof requires that you work at a level of abstraction that makes the program explainable.  One goal is to arrive at a &amp;quot;hands in the pocket&amp;quot; explanation of the program.  Ideally, you want an explanation so pithy, accurate and compelling that it's &amp;quot;obvious&amp;quot; that the associated program has to work.  And it doesn't require pages of UML.  When you're able to abstract/summarize a program in this way, you can deeply understand what it does, why it does it, what the limitations are, and how it fits into it's overall information processing context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Nothing -- nothing! -- is worse than programs which must be carefully reverse engineered into word processing documents.  Think what this means.  Software is a form of knowledge capture.  Yet, we have programs that are so opaque, confusing and dysfunctional that we must read the source to determine  what they might have meant.  When we reach this impasse, we also tend to find that the programs cannot be summarized.  They are a morass of exceptions and special cases, and there is rarely a way to accurately characterize what they&lt;/em&gt; mean &lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="perpetual-motion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Perpetual Motion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perpetual motion metaphor for formal techniques has one further problem.  Programs and their proofs live in different worlds.  The proof system is a &amp;quot;higher order&amp;quot; logic, distinct from the logic system in which software is implemented.  Proof systems contain a number of concepts that aren't actually part of the software system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our computer system relies on a simple Boolean world of True/False and the NAND operator.  Our proof system, however, introduces predicate qualification like &amp;quot;For All&amp;quot; (∀) and &amp;quot;There Exists&amp;quot; (∃).  In order to prove that a loop &amp;quot;makes progress&amp;quot; in each iteration, we may have to introduce propositions that aren't part of the final condition, but are features of our chosen algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &amp;quot;spec [defines] everything&amp;quot; isn't like perpetual motion at all.  The specification lives in &amp;quot;proof world&amp;quot; where we have abstraction and higher-order predicates.  The program lives in &amp;quot;hardware world&amp;quot; where we have approximations and limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since our spec is in a &amp;quot;larger&amp;quot; language, we don't have a situation where we need all the details of the finished program in order to write the specification.  The laws of thermodynamics don't apply.  In thermodynamics you can't win, you can't break even and you can't even get out of the game.  In software, your proof system is precisely how you &amp;quot;get out of the game&amp;quot;.  This is how you win: you transform a set of well-chosen conditions and proof techniques into a fully-detailed, working program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;And no, the fact that you didn't prove verything doesn't indict the technique as worthless.  That wasn't the goal.  Formal methods are a tool that use with version control, automated testing, databases, operating systems, interpreters and IDE's.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-process"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What gets omitted in Joel's notes (and RL's inappropriate thermodynamics metaphor) is the highly directed nature of the process.  The basic theory of formal methods says that we &amp;quot;somehow&amp;quot; derive a final post-condition from the requirements.  Then we prove some &amp;quot;arbitrary&amp;quot; program as satisfying the post condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a practical matter, we aren't stupid.  We have a sense of what works and what doesn't.  We know what we've already proven to work.  We have an idea of what kind of algorithm is required.  We don't write a random post-condition based on the requirements.  When we're doing reading the requirements, we write a post-condition with a hidden agenda.  It isn't a random mapping of requirements words onto post-condition formalisms.  We write the post-condition for the program we intend to develop.  One that we intend to satisfy the mushy English-language requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we develop the program, using the post-condition as a formal statement of the goal.  It's hard to emphasize that textbook formal methods demonstrate that we can do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;.  Practically, we have some pretty specific requirements that constrain the space in which we're working.  We're not going to flail at random; we're going to take the minimal number of steps to eke out our victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

It is helpful at disentangling the distinctions between various kinds of model-view-controller, and model-view-presenter alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important because the terminology gets borrowed and adulterated sometimes.  When we look at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://struts.apache.org/"&gt;Struts&lt;/a&gt; , we see one interpretation of the pattern.  Sun provides a lot of useful detail in their Developing Enterprise Applications with the J2EE Platform book, specifically, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/guidelines/designing_enterprise_applications_2e/web-tier/web-tier5.html"&gt;Web-Tier Application Framework Design&lt;/a&gt;  section.  When we look at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; , we see another implementation of MVC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of fat-client SWING applications, control is a pretty big deal.  In many cases, the GUI is stateful: GUI controls are enabled and disabled to guide the user through a complex set of actions.  Handling input and reflecting this in the state of the controls are important responsibilities of the control elements of the design pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to finely chop the responsibilities, leading to various MVP variations on the basic theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="web-interaction"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web Interaction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; HTTP world, where the GUI is somewhat simpler, there's less event-by-event processing, just big POST and GET actions.  This is where Struts and Django provide different versions of MVC.  Struts -- consistent with other Java-isms -- rubs your nose in the control element.  I must admit that I find the web.xml specification of interactions to be a largely tedious exercise in repeating myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a theoretical use case for maintenance and adaptation where someone rearranges the web transaction by updating the definitions in the web.xml file.  However, I've never actually seen this exercised.  Indeed, I've never seen a design that would tolerate this kind of change.  [And yes, I realize I'm throwing down the gauntlet for a good example of using this &amp;quot;flexibility&amp;quot;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seem to be two kinds of transactions: a few obvious pages (form for search, list of many objects, form for a single object, confirmation) or a multi-step transaction where each step is a piece of a complex object, and the sequence of operations is essentially hard-wired by a binding between business process and information needs.  Neither seems to benefit very much from the overhead of the web.xml configuration for a struts application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django seems to skin this cat with reasonable elegance.  Learning Django after learning Struts can be confusing at first.  Clearly, the model is the Django DB API.  They call it that -- you can't miss the implementation.  However, it isn't as clear that control is the parsing of the request and the mapping from URL to &amp;quot;view&amp;quot; function.  When you start looking at JSP as the view, it is odd to think of the Django templates as being just another part of the view element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any flexibility required from a multi-step transaction can be put into the URL mapping with relative ease, since that's the entire control element of the pattern.  If you want a Struts-style parameter for the &amp;quot;do-this-next&amp;quot; URL, you can easily provide this in the URL mapping, passing it as an argument to the view function.  With a little care you can make all of the view functions independent of any specific URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also means that presentation changes are often split across two parts of the view layer.  This is more manageable than it appears, since the template language of Django is (intentionally) limited to simple iteration and decision.  The Python objects used by the template have to be pretty simple; this helps steer the allocation of responsibility between these sub-layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-ajax-factor"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The AJAX Factor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you throw AJAX into this mix, the boundaries seem blurry.  Since AJAX happens in the browser, it's part of the view implementation.  But it's also another MVC.  The Model is some XML document and it's Javascript objects, the View is the browser's world, and the Control is all that Javascript making things happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net is that you have this two-part architecture with the HTTP MVC and the AJAX MVC.  You can, in principle, have a single conceptual model with Java, Javascript, XML and ORM implementations.  It sounds to be an icky level of complexity; if we use tools to create the mappings (e.g. JAXB) we can probably keep it all straight.  Or, if use just one compact, expressive language (Python/&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.json.org/"&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt; ) we could manage this nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essential feature is that Model elements of an AJAX MVC are accessed via a formal, secure public web-service API.  See &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=42722"&gt;JSON for Ajax Web Services&lt;/a&gt; .  [As an aside, this API seems to be the weakest part of AJAX implementations.  Some developers don't design the AJAX-related services with the kind of respect that ordinary web services are given.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="care-and-feeding"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Care and Feeding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Ctrl-Shift-B's posting dwells on Smalltalk, it's still useful.  It shows how an architecture can be documented.  It shows a clear, thoughtful presentation on how the architecture implements common design patterns.  It has some compare-and-contrast elements that can help developers (and maintainers) understand the general design principles and the strategy for allocating responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

But look for &amp;quot;A Story About User Stories and Test Driven Development&amp;quot;.  It's good stuff, weighing out the good and bad features of &amp;quot;by-the-book&amp;quot; TDD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ddj.com/"&gt;Dr. Dobb's Journal&lt;/a&gt;  ran and endless series about Agile, Test-Driven Pair Programming, and Java by Robert C. Martin.  Good stuff; it seemed to bracket the ideal, textbook TDD world-view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I tend to do isn't precisely the way TDD is usually described.  As Martin characterizes it, design happens as part of refactoring the code.  With deeply experienced people, I suspect that it looks like this is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But reading the articles in Sticky Minds helped me rethink what was really going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="design-still-happens"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Design Still Happens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I designed first and felt guilty about it.  Then I read the article by Gertrud Bjørnvig, James Coplien, and Neil Harrison; now I'm not as plagued by guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of their points is that a good architecture won't happen.  Indeed, you have to clarify the architecture, and be sure that everyone can articulate the architecture before you're going to get anywhere.  The test cases and code will follow this overall architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the important part.  The code must always be fit into an architecture; architecture leads, code follows.  Either you pick it explicitly, or you back into it by having someone -- haphazardly -- arrive at an architecture and start fitting code into that structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen this, but never knew precisely what I was seeing.  In a place dominated by mainframe folks, programs tend to process files and relatively few inputs and a reasonable number of outputs.  In a place dominated by Visual Basic programmers, everything has a GUI, even if the GUI just submits batch jobs. In a place &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2006_06_20-over_solving_the_problem_or_when_your_architect_is_a_dba.html"&gt;dominated by DBA's&lt;/a&gt;  everything has to be in the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The architecture and design is colored by experience and culture.  Left to their own devices, they work with the architecture they're most comfortable with.  If we turn people loose with a &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; TDD, they'll pick their favorite architecture and work toward that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="now-i-feel-better"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Now I Feel Better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One big piece of advice was to design first, then write tests, then write code.  Whew!  I had been doing that.  Now I realize it wasn't just me.  There is a gap in the &amp;quot;formal&amp;quot; definition of TDD.  You need to do some design first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to have an architecture, and everyone on the team has to be able to articulate the architecture.  Then the tests and code will fill in the available spaces correctly and consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I have some ways to test an implementation to see if it's the reasonably good, or it's the &lt;strong&gt;Wrong Kind of Fun&lt;/strong&gt;™.  An implementation is Fun when things fit together, and it seems to work.  It's the Wrong  Kind of Fun when you can't implement something, performance is abysmal, or you have maintainability or adaptability problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One indicator, BTW, seems to be the Paralysis of Analysis.  If you have a lot of open issues, and have invest a lot of time in very detailed plans, you may be having the &lt;strong&gt;Wrong Kind of Fun&lt;/strong&gt;.  Your technology choices don't fit your problem very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been working with customers who are trying to renovate old applications and bring the technology up to date.  These are riddled with examples of the Wrong Kind of Fun.  The technology choices in the project planning are more examples of &lt;strong&gt;WKoF&lt;/strong&gt;.  But they're boring.  Here's a much more colorful example.  And yes, it's a &lt;strong&gt;Python To The Rescue&lt;/strong&gt;™ story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-rpg-example"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The RPG Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I started a big time-waster.  As part of moving away from my old PPC-based Mac, I've got to release myself from two Hypercard applications that I still actually use once in a while.  One is my resume (a database, not a document), which I update constantly.  The other is -- well -- harder to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you old enough to remember Paper and Pencil Role-Playing Games, one of those RPG's is the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.herogames.com/home.htm"&gt;Hero Game System&lt;/a&gt; .  I found it to be a pile of fun.  My Fourth Edition Champions book is falling apart from the use.  I haven't actually played in years, but my little nephews have heard about this thing that old people did, called P&amp;amp;amp;P RPG's.  From my sister's prodding, I've been dusting things off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hero uses an elegant accounting system for describing characters.  Very elegant.  The fifth edition rules, indeed, are supported by a handy piece of software, Hero Designer, that appears to run everywhere and handle this accounting very nicely.  Very tempting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While elegant, it does require some care and a calculator.  Indeed, the math for some of this accounting can be baffling.  For basic features, it isn't so bad.  For Powers, however, the advantages, limitations and active points require a bunch of number crunching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the olden days, we fourth-edition Hero players were left to our own devices for doing the number crunching.  And in my case, my own device was a Hypercard stack that helped me concoct Hero characters, powers, spells, gadgets, devices and what-not with relative ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-underlying-data-model"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Underlying Data Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hero data model is full of ad-hoc special-cases.  It's a paper and pencil game, mediated by people, so ad-hoc rules aren't too intimidating.  Indeed, the appeal of P&amp;amp;amp;P RPG's is the human mediation.  This isn't &lt;strong&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/strong&gt;; it can be more subtle.  Of course, if your Game Master/Story Teller isn't very good, it's no better than WoW.  Indeed, some GM's are worse than playing WoW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hero rules started out with the express goal of being relatively simple.  There were several kinds of generalization-specialization relationships that were plainly in the minds of the original writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to specify the whole game, but I do need to note that there are both deep symmetries and casual ad-hoceries that break those symmetries.  Everything in Hero has a collection of features.  For characters, these features include a complete set of Characteristics, plus instances of all the various kinds of &amp;quot;Powers&amp;quot;: Skills, Talents, Perks and proper Powers.  Gadgets, Bases, Vehicles and what-not are generally just containers for Powers, but may also have a few Characterstics of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base Characteristics are relatively simple features: Strength for example is something you buy for your character.  A Character's Skills, Talents and Perks are slightly more complex features with more complex costs and effects.  The whole text of each effect is the content in the rule books; it doesn't really belong in a database.  What belongs in the database is the bewildering cost and effect calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, it's the Skills, Talents and Perks that separate a P&amp;amp;amp;P RPG from Multiplayer On-Line Role Playing Game (MORPG).  These require intelligent mediation by the GM, and clever use by the players.  Nothing beats those &lt;strong&gt;Clever Use of Skills&lt;/strong&gt;™ moments in a well-played game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Power is a collection of more detailed features, generally including a large number of Advantage and Limitation modifiers.  Here's where the math kicks into overdrive.  The power has a basic cost.  Folding in the advantages leads to an &amp;quot;active cost&amp;quot; -- how effective the power really is.  Folding in the limitations derives the final cost.  There are endless special cases and exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-hypercard-implementation"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Hypercard Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My old Hypercard implementation viewed this data model through the Hypercard lens.  In Hypercard, your application is a database built from a collection of Cards.  Each card has active controls, including data fields and unique blocks of code.  Additionally, each Card belongs to a Background that includes data fields and blocks of code.  The presentation is a union of the background controls (a type or classifier for cards) and instance controls on the card itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this Card-Background model, each background could have controls that are generic to Powers or Skills, and a card would have controls that are unique to a specific Power or that Skill.  Each card is effectively a class definition; the data filled into the fields create the instance.  Each background, then, becomes a kind of superclass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't work out well.  It's the &lt;strong&gt;Wrong Kind of Fun&lt;/strong&gt;™.  Yes, it has a handy built-in zero-pain, zero-cost GUI.  However, the object model is really flat.  You have background and card, and that's it.  Having a single background for Powers isn't good enough because standard Movement Powers are radically different from the ad-hoc heavy Special Powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I wrote this -- back in the '90's -- I've been struggling with ways to make use of a proper object-oriented data model.  Okay, it's a very casual hobby, so I haven't spent a lot of time on it.  When I played RPG's with my kids, I revisited the problem with no real resolution.  I knew that Hypercard was the &lt;strong&gt;Wrong Kind of Fun&lt;/strong&gt;, but I didn't have an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tool-and-platform-bias"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tool and Platform Bias&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a gnarly, complex data model, what do you do?  The data model seems pretty easy to normalize, until you start considering the exceptions.  Compounding the data modeling problem are the presentation and use case issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, a relational database tugs at the corners of my mind.  A tidy table-row-column data model, a few simple SQL scripts, and we have the rules in neat buckets.  Then, another tidy data model for characters and gadgets, and we can do simple joins between the character and the base data and -- voila -- character sheets and GM notes.  Sadly, it can't be this simple.  The number of ad-hoc special cases is almost unlimited.  While it's possible to create a generic cost function, it would be simpler to have variant cost functions for each special case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, an OO database tugs in the other direction.  A tidy class model defines all of the features of a character or gadget.  An instance of the class model is the specific character or gadget.  Further, characters and gadgets can be treated as features, allowing recursive build-up of complex characters that make us of the Multiform power or even more complex Power Framework rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither has a built-in GUI.  So, we're really looking at a whole platform, not just a data model.  Further, the C++ and Java toolsets that I've had at my disposal in the past weren't ideal for this.  Java would require an object model, a persistence framework, a GUI framework, and lead to a mountain of programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="use-cases"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use Cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the use cases?  There are a few, but they all amount to the following.  I create a character, gadget, vehicle, base, magical spell, artifact, whatever.  I want a standardized description, in the style of the Hero Rules.  I want correct cost and effect calculations done automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I need drag-and-drop?  Checkboxes?  Radio buttons?  Sure, they'd be nice.  But there are some features which are more central than a flashy GUI presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I want persistence.  A simple directory of stuff in easy-to-edit flat files will do nicely.  In short, the standard XML or Domain Specific Language (DSL) use case applies here.  I want structured content in a human-readable form.  I want some schema validation, and I have some transformations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I want composition.  I want to be able to have standard libraries of things from which I can compose more complex stuff.  A magical spell, for example, is a kind of Gadget: it is a combination of Powers, Advantages and Limitations, with a name and some effects.  A collection of these spell definitions helps me  build characters quickly and simply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, I want standardized reports.  The Hero Rules have a long form and short form.  I want these two results as the result of a transformation.  Part of this will include the overall cost, allowing me to fine-tune a definition or a composite character to keep balance in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't really need much of a GUI.  Take that off the table, and we're back to data model and processing tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-to-the-rescue"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Python To The Rescue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's two ways that Python helped me to tease my tools out of Hypercard, and create some significant improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the GUI problem was solved by a blinding inspiration: &lt;strong&gt;Text Files Work&lt;/strong&gt;.  A character, gadget, spell, vehicle or base can be a first-class piece of Python code.  We can encode the Hero rules as a set of class definitions.   These classes need a few methods which produce a tidy report, and not too much more.  Each character or gadget is an instance of a class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python becomes a Domain Specific Language for describing Hero characters and gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the validation rules?  In some cases, a Power has options which are exclusive, or there are minima or maxima.  We can throw exceptions when attempting to construct an invalid object.  The use case is quite simple: we edit some text, execute the text, and read the messages.  The IDLE editor becomes our GUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the ad-hoc special cases are simply subclass definitions, in the most natural and obvious ways.  We don't need to force-fit our complex data into the relational mold.  Instead, we define the obvious attributes and the methods we're interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="duck-typing-and-the-development-cycle"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Duck Typing and the Development Cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual hard part is coming up with a suitably general framework for Characteristics, Skills, Talents, Perks and Powers.  And we need the necessary collection framework for Characters, Gadgets, Vehicles and Bases. These have a pleasant recursive relationship: a Character can contain Characters as well as Gadgets, Vehicles and Bases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Python doesn't impose a sophisticated data model as a requirement.  We can develop in relative ignorance, adding features as necessary.  At some point, we need to refactor.  We can easily refactor without extensive breakage.  In particular, changing an attribute to a property (with the property built-in function) helps us evolve from a relatively simple model to a more sophisticated model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, a basic set of Test Cases, built with &lt;strong&gt;unittest&lt;/strong&gt;, helps us to evaluate our implementation directly.  As soon as we finish defining a class for a Power, we can write a simple test case to be sure that we've got a working implementation.  We can implement the examples from the Hero Rules to be absolutely sure that we're producing correct results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-no-database-where-s-the-persistence"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What?  No Database?  Where's the Persistence?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the principle that is sometimes lost on my clients.  &lt;strong&gt;Persistence&lt;/strong&gt;  does not mean &lt;strong&gt;Database&lt;/strong&gt;.  While SQL has it's advantages, it isn't the final word in persistence.  XML is also a good, standardized persistence mechanism.  A DSL may even be better, even if it isn't standardized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, we have Python as object data base.  A file of Python source is the object model.  It is an executable persistent object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can, for instance, import the Python object definition, and query it, process it and report on it.  We change the data object &amp;quot;manually&amp;quot;.  So it seems like we could &amp;quot;break the rules&amp;quot; or make changes that somehow bypass the &amp;quot;business rules&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;data validation rules&amp;quot;.  However, since our constructors embody these validation rules, we can't execute (&amp;quot;instantiate&amp;quot;) the model without the rules being satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the only capability I seem to be lacking is concurrent updates.  Wait, isn't that what Subversion does?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-quick-example"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Quick Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example Gadget definition.  There's a lot of potential cleanup.  For now, I have long-winded names for the classes.  Since the DSL is Python code, classes can have aliases, giving us an easy way to provide better-looking names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
import hero
darkArmor= hero.Gadget(
  'Dark Armor',
  18,
  hero.Armor(
    armor=6,
    lim= ( hero.Focus_ObviousInaccessible(), )
  ),
  hero.Darkness(
     radius=2,
     lim= (
       hero.Focus_ObviousInaccessible(),
       hero.ActivationRoll_Activation12(),
     )
  ),
  hero.Superleap(
    distance=10,
    lim= ( hero.Focus_ObviousInaccessible(), )
  ),
)
darkArmor.longReport()
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I see organizations stymied by a few individuals that seem to subvert initiatives and prevent progress.  Or they somehow evade being useful and spend all their time in hand-wringing and &amp;quot;yeah-but&amp;quot;-ing.  I'm not sure how to exploit what they can do, while getting past the stalls and evasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a conversation that I'm labeling as &amp;quot;passive aggressive&amp;quot;.  What I think I'm hearing is a developer with some kind of private agenda, coupled with an unwillingness to actually say anything.  Instead, we have this weird non-communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;We'd like to do X to solve this set of problems.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAP:  &amp;quot;I don't understand the problem.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;I sent you the list of 38 things which are broken, all of which are different examples of a few specific architectural problems.  We're solving that set of problems.  Indeed, I see you brought the list to this meeting.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAP:  &amp;quot;Fine.  What do you need from me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;Can you do X to solve those problems?  Or, more precisely, what would it cost to do X to solve those problems?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAP:  &amp;quot;I don't see how X solves these problems.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;Good point.  What solution do you have?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAP:  Shrugs.  Shakes head.  Rolls eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;Do you have an alternative?  If so, we need to know what that is.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAP:  &amp;quot;No, nothing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;Okay, back to my question: can you do X to solve these problems?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's as far as the conversation gets.  PA responses vary from &amp;quot;I don't understand the problem&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;I don't see how X solves the problem&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;I don't see how X would work&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;I have situation where X can't work&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;I guess I'll just have to see it first&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Good luck with that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, there was a &amp;quot;specific&amp;quot; complaint.  It was actually several use cases rolled into one complaint about X.  It took some doing, but each complaint was of the form &amp;quot;If we follow this process, we'll wind up in a situation where the process breaks down because we'll always, inevitably do the wrong thing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doomed To Failure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This PAP's point was that a defied process so narrowly constrains us that we loose all ability to think.  Some PAP's lament the loss of &amp;quot;creativity&amp;quot; in a defined process.  Other PAP's lament the inability to make rational cost-benefit decisions within a defined process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question in this case was, &amp;quot;Why won't we apply your kind of good decision-making?&amp;quot;  The first response sounded like &amp;quot;we never learn.&amp;quot;  The second response was a &amp;quot;Well, I understood that...&amp;quot; followed by some unsubstantiated pronouncement about the process.  The pronouncement wasn't a misinterpretation, it wasn't even a rumor.  It was a pronouncement that -- at the time -- seemed out-of-left-field random.  For example &amp;quot;I thought a tool did all this&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I always expected that the API's worked like this&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I need a GUI to remove user involvement&amp;quot; or some such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, it was really &amp;quot;this process won't work.&amp;quot;  Or perhaps &amp;quot;process, in general, doesn't solve problems, I solve problems.&amp;quot;  Since it isn't their process, it's &lt;strong&gt;Doomed to Failure&lt;/strong&gt;™.  This kind of evasion is closely allied with the next, and I lump them both into the category of having a private agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-real-answer"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Real Answer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another example, we spent an amazing amount of time trying to work out a plan for solution X.  Since we had a Passive Aggressive Programmer involved, solution X was doomed.  The planning didn't really matter, since it wouldn't really work.  There was no &amp;quot;solution&amp;quot; because we don't know enough.  What we didn't know enough about varied through time, but we never knew enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not that we lack details.  It's just that we never have the right details.  And the missing details are dependent on other imponderables.  In the long run, this isn't aligned with the PAP's private agenda, and can't be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct questions get no answer at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, hints were dropped.  Specifically, the lead-off Passive-Aggressive questions: &amp;quot;Why are we here?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;What Problem Are We Solving?&amp;quot;  These are hints that the PAP doesn't agree.  Indeed, the PAP has a better idea.  However, the true hallmark of the passive part of this is that there is no usable answer to a direct question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, parsing the asides, non-answers, and By The Ways revealed a &amp;quot;consideration&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;side issue&amp;quot; that is a potential alternative solution.  This is a potentially viable alternative.  It hasn't worked before;  which is why I'm involved.  However, the point of being Passive-Aggressive (from my point of view) is that their approach is better, but they'll only passively make aggressive moves against any other idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there's a real answer, and it has some merit, the PAP seems to have two competing directions.  They want to follow their own agenda, but they don't want any real responsibility.  As near as I can tell, they just want to be left alone.  They don't want to cooperate, lead or follow.  They want to be followed, but don't want to do very much to assure that they take the lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-wall-of-fog"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Wall Of Fog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another example, we wasted considerable time trying to work out a definition of the actual problem.  Since we had a Passive Aggressive Programmer involved, we can't fully define something.  Instead, we have endless rounds of the Yet Another Subtlety™ game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;So the process needs to do X&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAP:  &amp;quot;Essentially.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;You say that like there's something else.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAP: &amp;quot;Actually, it's X and Y.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;So, the process needs to do X and Y?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAP:  &amp;quot;What do you mean by Y?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;You brought it up, what did you mean?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAP:  &amp;quot;It could mean Y1 or Y2.  Some people go one way, some people go the other way.  What do you mean by Y?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;You brought it up, not me.  What do you mean?  Let's try this.  We're talking about requirements.  What is required?  Think of it this way.  As an outside consultant, I'm selling you X and Y1.  Would you pay money for that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAP:  &amp;quot;No, we'd only pay for X.  In that sense, Y's of no tangible value.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;Okay.  So the process needs to do X.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAP:  &amp;quot;Essentially....&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, we never come to an actual understanding.  There's nuance piled on top of nuance.  It seems like the nuance card is really saying &amp;quot;I know this, and only I know this; you can never understand it.  Just leave me alone.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's charming is that the PAP's solution to X wasn't working and couldn't easily be made to work.  There was this &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2006_02_24-rat_holes_of_lost_time.html"&gt;Rat Holes of Lost Time&lt;/a&gt; ™ that was sucking up resources and things never quite worked. My approach is to stop digging a deeper hole.  Climb out and look all around.  Perhaps there's another, more productive, less error-prone approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, since we can't identify all the requirements, we can't talk about alternatives.  It's a clever strategy for maintaining control without actually saying anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-political-shield"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Political Shield&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My final example is from the developers who are absolutely convinced that politics is the number one consideration in any discussion of a solution.  The conversation works like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAP:  &amp;quot;I need help with X.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;Why on earth are you doing that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAP:  &amp;quot;It is the only politically acceptable solution.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;It would be simpler to implement Y.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAP:  &amp;quot;Unacceptable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;Do you actually know how Y works?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAP:  &amp;quot;Doesn't matter how brilliant Y is, it's unacceptable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  &amp;quot;How about we extract some important lessons from Y, and apply them to improving X.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAP:  &amp;quot;It would still be unacceptable, since Y is tainted by ... &amp;quot;  The reasons amount to nothing more than &amp;quot;It's not X&amp;quot;, or more accurately, &amp;quot;It's not my original idea, therefore, it is &lt;strong&gt;Doomed To Failure&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="unshakable-beliefs"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unshakable Beliefs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Political Animals seem to have the least shakable belief system.  When their pet solution doesn't work well, we have to engage in a pointless conversation about alternatives.  I say pointless because I try to lift up alternatives, and they provide a large number of relatively irrational reasons why politics is more important than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, to try and get the conversation on track, I try to help them prioritize.  Often, politics winds up at the top of the list of important considerations.  Correct Functionality, Optimal Use of Resources, Maintainability, Adaptability and Cost are -- often -- lumped as &amp;quot;technical,&amp;quot; and are secondary to politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation often devolves into PAP lecturing me about the &amp;quot;real world.&amp;quot;  This often includes the &amp;quot;perception is reality&amp;quot; justification.  Since perception is reality, only politically sensitive perceptions matter.  And the fact that they can't be made to work is just lack of cleverness or effort on my part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm partial to the &amp;quot;someone else must have had this problem; in all of your company's consultants, you can't find anyone who can solve this problem?&amp;quot;  That's generally when I find a way to excuse myself.  Clearly, they're right.  Someone else knows this, and it isn't me.  Further, there isn't anyone in their entire company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="patterns-of-non-performance"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patterns of Non-Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen the &lt;strong&gt;Secret Plan&lt;/strong&gt;  folks.  They don't provide input, and they don't actually help, either.  I've seen the &lt;strong&gt;Wall of Fog&lt;/strong&gt;  folks who seem to flip-flop between the paralysis of analysis and pitching a non-solution because it's the only idea they've got.  I've also seen the &lt;strong&gt;Political Shield&lt;/strong&gt;  folks who have such a profound (and unshakable) trust in organizational politics that rationality can't seem to enter the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to do?  Listening is important, even if they're not talking.  Secret Plan folks will eventually tip there hand.  They just won't tip it to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 1&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Never go to meetings alone.  Have a quiet colleague, someone who takes notes, and can be confided in.  Often, that's my job.  Recently, I've had to bring people along to do that.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 2&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Cut off the worrying.  Analysis of problems and enumeration of alternatives is fun for a while, but has a diminishing value.  At some point the problem statement is good enough.  Faced with this, you have to design a good solution, since requirements will erupt forever from a professional &amp;quot;yeah-but&amp;quot;-er.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 3&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Transcending politics is just hard.  Looking at a &amp;quot;hypothetical&amp;quot; solution that is free from political constraints is often impossible.  The Political Animals seem to be the best at having a Secret Plan, and erecting a Wall of Fog.  I think that the Political Shield is really a way to defend one of the other strategies.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

In some cases, this is either impossible or valueless.  It may be that the application is so hopelessly bad that we can't partition it.  Often, the batch processing lens distorts the business processes.  In order to  understand the legacy processing, we need to account for this lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More commonly, the data model is so out of date from current business practice, that there's little real value in attempting to preserve it.  We need to find the underlying model first, and then determine how the program imposes the application processing on this model.  To develop a model from the legacy code, we have to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2007_09_21-deconstructing_programs_from_c_or_finding_the_objects.html"&gt;Find the Objects&lt;/a&gt; .  In some cases, the actual objects are so distorted by the implementation lens that this can be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When dealing with legacy batch programs, there are a number of typical design patterns.  If we understand these design patterns, we can also see how they distort the data model as well as the processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-relational-lens"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Relational Lens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest data model, when viewed through the relational lens, is distorted in terrible ways.  I've had DBA's try to tell me that data manipulation (Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete) does not have any underlying business &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot;.  They're just operations on data.  The &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot; is that there are transactions and persistence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we often find is that the structure imposed by relational tables has distorted the underlying business entity.  In particular, a relational databases don't have proper containers, so collective structures are often flattened out through a join operation, making the resulting objects appear to be peer-like.  In fact, some attributes of the result rows belong to the container and other attributes define a child contained within a parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A certain amount of processing follows a &amp;quot;group-by&amp;quot; (also known as a &amp;quot;Control Break&amp;quot;) design pattern to reconstruct the original parent-child relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-flat-file-lens"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Flat File Lens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flat file data model is not as obsolete as one would hope.  Much data is taken out of a reasonable structure, transformed into a series of rows, and reconstructed by another application.  Even a translation to XML can lose some of the relationships in the original structure.  Yes, ID= and IDREF= attributes can preserve all of the original object structure, but these are not always used well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the rare case of truly ancient software (e.g., IBM Z/OS VSAM files or similar structures) we often have files with the following icky properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variant Record Types (i.e., not in first normal form).  COBOL folks call this a &amp;quot;redefined&amp;quot; record because some part of the record definition has a &amp;quot;REDEFINES&amp;quot; clause.  C folks call this a &amp;quot;union&amp;quot; because the union definition is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex Joins and Repeated Data (i.e., not in second normal form).  We may find that we have several different files that repeat some common pieces of data; effectively restating a relationship.  In each file, we may find a slightly different mix of attributes.  These must be combined to reconstruct a complete entity.  However, we'll also find that the data rows from the various files involve contradictions that must be resolved manually.  Plan on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derived Data (i.e., not in third normal form).  Derived data in legacy applications -- almost universally -- cannot be understood from the available data.  In some cases, there are hidden constants or configuration values.  In other cases, data from some other source is folded in via a cryptic join-like lookup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, these problems are part of the flat-file implementation of the business entities.  Each resulting entity will be considerably more sophisticated than the original file layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="some-batch-design-patterns"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some Batch Design Patterns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the most recent example, it wasn't clear what constituted the business entity, and what operations where a merely temporary state change, and what operations where the enduring state change for the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few tests to confirm that the functions had been migrated to methods seemed sufficient.  However, as things progressed, it became clear that simplistic refactoring to encapsulate all fields with getters and setters was a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="not-all-updates-are-created-equal"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not All Updates Are Created Equal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After converting most of a 10,000 line program, and starting to get some performance data from the profiler, a few methods showed up as very heavily used.  These were string conversions from the underlying model object.  Clearly, we should be able to cache results and save some conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most attributes are static, but, a few attributes are changing, so we don't have an easily cacheable value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Weirdly, the question came to me in a context so twisted and bizarre that it's a little hard to sort out what -- precisely -- was going on.  First, what goes in a database, then, things that muddy the waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before talking about databases, we need to look closely at our objective: knowledge capture and modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="modeling"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Modeling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software captures knowledge about data and processing.  Generally, our software knowledge capture involves building a model of the real world inside our computer systems.  Sometimes it's just a paper model (e. g., a UML depiction of something.)  Mostly, however, software is a kind of model of some interesting, valuable aspect of the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An object-oriented model of the world lets us capture that information in the form of objects and their interactions.  We define classes of objects, which include the object's attributes and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another common model is a data-only model; for example, the SQL implementation of the relational model.  A third common model is a procedure-only model; for example PL/SQL code, or C programs.  Yes, I'm deprecating these models as incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, when we're doing software development we need to get to an object-oriented model.  We can get there directly, via Python or Java.  Or we can get there indirectly by attempting to integrate a data-only model and a procedure-only model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-rdbms-bias"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The RDBMS Bias&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many well-meaning folks get all tangled up with the data-only model.  For some reason, the database appears as the central arterial essence of modeling and everything else is just a kind of tributary or organ feed by the lifeblood information flowing through that database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;  more important than process; that much is clear.  We preserve data when converting among various kinds of application software.  We change processes frequently and freely.  Data, however, we preserve as the foundation for new processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we have to avoid conflating data with database.  And we further have to avoid conflating database with a particular vendor's implementation.  Oracle is not the same as database; database is not the same as data.  But you hear people talk about Oracle as if it &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt;  the enterprise information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-goes-in-the-database"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Goes In The Database?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since our goal is a model with reasonably fidelity to the real world, and that model must involve both data and processing, our model is object-oriented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, our desire is to put objects into the database.  We have three fundamental choices: an object data store, blobs in a relational data store, or an object-relational mapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Object data stores suffer from a taint.  &amp;quot;It ain't SQL&amp;quot;.  Even some of the fancy, extended Object SQL variants don't appeal enough to people who have money and are terribly afraid of the downside consequences of appearing to fail.  I've learned that failure (or the appearance of failure) hurts more than a success of equal magnitude.  People will work harder to avoid losing $100 than they will to gain $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blobs in a relational store have a narrow band where they make sense.  Generally, a blobby attribute makes the most sense.  We have a blob surrounded by ordinary relational database attributes.  While SQL can handle most attributes, it can't handle the blob; that has to be taken outside the SQL environment for processing.  It's opaque to SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An approach where everything is a blob, and the relational database is just storage for blobs is creepy.  Why not use an object database?  Oh, right, the taint.  Consequently, I've had customers suggest that we make everything a blob and force it into Oracle, bypassing all other SQL features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-orm-friendly-model"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The ORM-Friendly Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we focus on Object-Relational Mapping, we have numerous small victories.  First, we analyze our problem in terms of real-world entities, their attributes and behaviors.  We develop a software design, mapping real-world things to objects which are constrained by the need to implement them in Python (or Java or Ruby.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can then develop a relational database design which carries the objects as &amp;quot;cleanly&amp;quot; as possible.  This SQL model will (often) look peculiar or even unorthodox to fat, old DBA's of my vintage.  [Kentucky Hills, late 1950's, good years.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-in-an-object-relational-model"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's in an Object-Relational Model?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental entities usually map (more-or-less) to tables in a pretty direct way.  However, the real world has innumerable kinds of relationships.  The OO world tries to match this by applying a little bit of rigor.  The relational world, however, has only one kind of relationship: the foreign key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have a good object-relational mapping layer, we can provide pleasant object-friendly definitions which can be mapped to Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) without burning too many brain calories.  If, on the other hand, we lack a good ORM mapping, we have to think through each kind of relationship and how we'll implement it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ORM experience is split four ways among &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/"&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/model-api/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; , totally home-brewed designs, and the kind of ORM that &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ibatis.apache.org/"&gt;iBatis&lt;/a&gt;  handles.  SQLAlchemy and Django handle everything, including DDL.  iBatis requires that you do a competent database design, but it will build your Java objects neatly for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these (even my own home brew) have to cope with transforming rich object semantics into limited relational implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have tables and columns, of course.  Each table has a unique, system-generated surrogate primary key (PK) and whatever is required to assure that the PKs are unique.  A unique primary key index, or a suitable PK column declaration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relational implementation always has foreign keys (FK).  The foreign keys can always be constrained with declared, formal FK constraint clauses.  The FK's are always based on the surrogate keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For performance reasons, you might want to add indexes on non-key fields.  More power to you.  That's just performance tuning, not the essential model structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-missing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Missing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of things which are explicitly not present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Triggers&lt;/strong&gt;.  While some argue for triggers, I haven't had a good experience with a mature application.  Maintenance of triggers seems to get exponentially more expensive.  Since we have object class definitions, it isn't clear why we need triggers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stored Procedures&lt;/strong&gt;.  Please don't put code in the DB.  It is a configuration management nightmare.  Further, I can't figure out what the allure is. ` PL/SQL is slow &amp;lt;{filename}/blog/2007/05/2007_05_27-plsql_and_java_the_benchmark_challenge_revised.rst&amp;gt;`_ .  While some people try to tell me that PL/SQL improves performance, I can't find much tangible evidence; no customer has benchmarks, and I can't see the basis for the claim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cascade Delete Rules&lt;/strong&gt;.  These seem cool, but they aren't exercised much, and the few places where people can delete things, the application handles it nicely.  &amp;quot;What about transient data?&amp;quot;  Transient data doesn't belong in a database: use files or queues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Random Constraints&lt;/strong&gt;.  The SQL Check Constraint is one of those things where there's a blurry distinction between &amp;quot;essential&amp;quot; features of the entity and special cases, exceptions and situational policies.  The check constraints are rarely universally true, so why try to embed them in the database?  There are few enduring, essential, universal constraints, outside mandatory foreign key and not-null relationships.  Just about everything else will evolve with the use cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-about"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What About ...?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about composite keys?  What about them?  They're a bunch of columns.  Use a secondary index for fast access.  Oh, they have to be unique?  Use a unique secondary index.  A composite key isn't the unique, never-changing object identifier.  It may not change much, but the mere possibility that it could change means it isn't a permanent row identifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; keys?  They're columns.  Use a secondary index.  They're rarely updated, but rarely isn't never; rarely isn't the same as &amp;quot;impossible&amp;quot;.  The surrogate key can't be changed; and doesn't need to be, since no one can see it except the DBA and developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about &amp;quot;CRUD-Level Stored Procedures?&amp;quot;  Create Retrieve Update Delete (CRUD) rules depends on context.  You can claim that each table should be wrapped by stored procedures to implement the CRUD rules.  By so doing, you might be breaking up the relational mapping.  For example, you may have a subclass associated with it's superclass via a 1:1 join.  The CRUD for the subclass now covers two tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay, How about CRUD rules for the entities?&amp;quot; is the response.  But isn't that what our object class definitions are for?  Are we now going to duplicate code in &amp;quot;CRUD-level&amp;quot; stored procedures plus class definitions in Java?  Nope.  No CRUD-level stored procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="it-s-already-here-and-we-re-holding-a-hammer-arguments"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's Already Here™ and We're Holding A Hammer™ Arguments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;It's Already Here&lt;/strong&gt;™ argument goes like this.  Since the RDBMS is already here, we may as well use it.  We paid for all these features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;We're Holding A Hammer&lt;/strong&gt;™ argument is the traditional view that holding a hammer means we treat each problem like a nail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither are very compelling.  Just because it's here, doesn't mean it solves our problem.  Just because we're comfortable using it, doesn't mean it is particularly helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="my-peers-are-jerks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Peers are Jerks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one took the cake.  Here's the email subject line: &amp;quot;What belong in data model and what belong in OO model ?&amp;quot;  After several more emails, there surfaced a horror story about three separate problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The programming was so bad that the programmers refused to use the data model.  They insisted that RI constraints either be turned off deferred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data modeling was so bad that the programmers couldn't understand it.  The DBA's were forced to turn the RI constraints off or defer the checks.  Nothing quite so much fun as DB2 tables in Check Pending state for a day or two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The organization was so bad that the programmers and the DBA couldn't coexist except by strange passive-aggressive attacks.  &amp;quot;My code is optimal and involves the least effort on my part; your constraints must permit this application design&amp;quot; -- &amp;quot;My data model is optimal and involves the least effort on my part; your code must conform to this model&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="babies-and-bathwater"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Babies and Bathwater&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up front I alluded to a context so twisted and bizarre that it's a little hard to sort out what was going on.  Here's the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DBA who either was a jerk or was enduring the ineptitude of programmers who were jerks, claimed that the important lesson learned was the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Since then, I always delay my RI checking until the commit is issued.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a bad organization leads to a strange, purely technological work-around to bad software, bad database design or both.  Later, our constraint-relaxing DBA tried to make this point to a DB2 user.  In DB2, they don't seem to have Oracle's flavor of constraint deferral.  Indeed, our DBA is told by the DB2 user that the organization doesn't make heavy use of RI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now our DBA is feeling half-way down the slippery slope of damnation.  Clearly, RI is essential.  Yet, this DBA was punished into turning it off, and then met someone who (gasp!) says that RI isn't even essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-was-told-to-do-the-wrong-thing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I Was Told To Do The Wrong Thing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone's pressured to do something technically dumb.  Here's my response:  I recognize that there's correct design, and then there's things that you do even though the people paying the bills are wrong.  The most important thing about being pressured to do something wrong is the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone makes mistakes.  In this case, you happen to know in advance that this is a mistake.  Most people don't find out for years that they did something wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every implementation has significant flaws.  In this case, it isn't a product of ignorance and you have a better alternative.  Most implementations won't be examined critically for years.  And even then, they will be examined by outside consultants and everyone deprecate their assessment as being a blatant attempt to win the conversion/rewrite/renovation business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every manager who is out of touch with the users (and their use cases) as well as the technology still has one thing left that they understand: the schedule.  Using the schedule as a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2005_09_15-essay_11_management_trump_cards.html"&gt;management trump card&lt;/a&gt;  is generally bad.  In this case, you happen to foresee the consequences of bad decision-making.  Most times it's only in hindsight that you see the mistake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine what this situation will look like in a few years.  Pretend you just walked in to find this mess in production.  Pretend you're that someone who will be asked to find a better approach.  Someone who will be asked to document the potential improvements.  Someone who will be asked to make the business case that the mistakes are more costly to preserve than they are to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with blindly stupid organization or managerial pressure, just do the following:  Start writing down the situation that someone else will discover in the future.  Document what the response should be to straighten it out.  Be factual, precise, and provide plenty of examples.  Don't play the blame game; it isn't helpful.  Don't fall into the trap of providing cost, schedule, ROI or other information that management uses to stall or deny a project.  Just document the mistake and the fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provide it to your replacement when you leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

While your basic API methods are relatively few in number, each language and platform introduces new options.  Without some focus, it's challenging to produce a big, fluffy description of all potential alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the interesting thing is the value of pipelining in the first place.  Often, folks get confused and start insisting on multiple threads, more memory or some other non-solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, I sometimes hear confusion about how pipelining even helps.  I've had too many questions about how to avoid bottlenecks in a pipeline, as if having a single slow step negates the value of the concurrent processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point here is that we can achieve concurrency fairly simply.  It doesn't have to involve complex API's.  We can use a domain specific language (e.g. a shell) or we can use XML Pipeline Language (XPL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="oracle-pipelining"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oracle Pipelining&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle, for example, has -- for a while now -- offered a pipelining feature so that parts of a program don't have to wait for the entire query to finish before processing rows from the query.  These pipeline functions yield objects that are -- in effect -- table rows one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big benefit is that we won't wait for the entire cursor to fetch all the rows.  Instead, we can apply a function to each row and yield that row to the calling application program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, effectively, what the Python &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;yield&lt;/tt&gt;  construct does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do this without suffering through the complexities of Oracle or PL/SQL.  I want to emphasize the suffering and complexities here.  First, there isn't a lot of inherent parallelism in PL/SQL; this mechanism gives us a tiny bit of parallelism between parts of our application and the rows being built in the database.  Parallelism among non-database operations isn't possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="shell-pipelining"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shell Pipelining&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every POSIX-compliant operating system (that is to say, everything but Windows and IBM's Z/OS) has trivial access to a standardized set of API's for creating pleasant pipelines.  Best, of course, is that all of the variants on the Shell do this for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shell offers a wonderfully sophisticated math-like language of operators for connecting processes (and files) into tidy process composition expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several math-like operators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;;&lt;/tt&gt; (also written as newline, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;\n&lt;/tt&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;|&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;||&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with ()'s for grouping.  However, this isn't often-enough seen as the tidy little language that it really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="process-composition"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Process Composition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operators have to be thought of as &amp;quot;composition&amp;quot;, as in &amp;quot;process X is composed of process Y and Z&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each operator defines a radically different kind of composition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most commonly used operator is newline or ;.  This operator effectively creates a new process composed of two processes executed sequentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shell may optimize this by simply executing processes sequentially.  However, when we introduce ()'s, we force the shell to actually create this new process in the form of a subshell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The | operator creates a new process composed of two processes which execute concurrently, and have stdout of one process connected to stdin of the subsequent process.  This is fairly easy to understand, but is often treated as an &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; topic in books on Linux or the shell.  I'm not sure why this is treated as advanced, since it's so simple and so effective for improving performance of complex processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-confusing-special-case"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Confusing Special Case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/tt&gt; operator, because it can be used in a special unary context, seems to create the most confusion.  For some reason, a construct like &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Y &amp;amp; Z&lt;/tt&gt; isn't seen as two concurrent processes, but as Y running in some obscure nohup-like mode, and Z is part of ordinary sequential composition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unary &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/tt&gt; operator (at the end of a single line) is the most common use for &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/tt&gt;, but it has to be seen as a special case.  When we do something like &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;python idle.py &amp;amp;&lt;/tt&gt; it isn't an example of process composition in an obvious way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The binary &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/tt&gt; operator (between programs) is fairly rare.  Why run two programs concurrently when there's no obvious connection?  In many data warehouse contexts, we have a number of preconditions for a given load.  So we may have something like &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;(A &amp;amp; B &amp;amp; C); D&lt;/tt&gt;.  In this case, we have three preconditions which all must finish before D can start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conditional-composition"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conditional Composition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;||&lt;/tt&gt; operators for composition are elegant ways to specify a kind of composition which is dependent on a condition.  In the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/tt&gt; case, the left-hand process must finish normally.  In the || case, the left-hand process must not finish normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conditional composition was borrowed by perl, and used wisely, it can make a program somewhat easier to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="alternate-notations"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alternate Notations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the XML folks have concocted several alternate notation for this, including Apache &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://commons.apache.org/jelly/"&gt;Jelly&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/xpl/"&gt;XPL&lt;/a&gt; .  XPL doesn't seem to have a lot of implementations floating around.  &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.orbeon.com/"&gt;Orbeon&lt;/a&gt;  seems to be it; however, the Wikipedia page lists some other implementations including Oracle and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://smallx.dev.java.net/"&gt;smallx&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XPL adds a lot of detail (and a lot of syntax.)  In this case, I'm not sure the extra syntax provides any extra value.  The shell's syntax, which could be called a domain-specific language (DSL) solves the problem nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2006_12_23-xml_one_ring_to_rule_them_all.html"&gt;Lure of XML&lt;/a&gt;  is strong.  The shell's language seems easy to parse and unambiguous.  Why add syntax?  How much less ambiguous can we make it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Incidentally, XPL is a heavily overloaded name.  See &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.xplproject.org.uk/index.php/XPL_News"&gt;http://wiki.xplproject.org.uk/index.php/XPL_News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/XPL/"&gt;http://www.cs.toronto.edu/XPL/&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://csdl2.computer.org/persagen/DLAbsToc.jsp?resourcePath=/dl/proceedings/&amp;amp;toc=comp/proceedings/icis/2007/2841/00/2841toc.xml&amp;amp;DOI=10.1109/ICIS.2007.197"&gt;http://csdl2.computer.org/persagen/DLAbsToc.jsp?resourcePath=/dl/proceedings/&amp;amp;toc=comp/proceedings/icis/2007/2841/00/2841toc.xml&amp;amp;DOI=10.1109/ICIS.2007.197&lt;/a&gt;  for other meanings.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="using-concurrency"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using Concurrency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be challenging to reduce a big, complex algorithm down into smaller, pipelined steps.  However, doing this has a number of advantages, even if a pipelined shell script is never used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, breaking a big algorithm down into small algorithms is always helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the data structures which are passed from step to step can be done as in-memory structures or they can be explicitly written to a pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Java, we have a Pipe class that we can use to pass serialized objects among Java threads or processes.   And we can use commodity shell constructs to compose fast, parallel processing applications rather than Java or Oracle constructs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we have such a rich set of shell script operators for concurrency, we don't really need to deeply understand a lot of Java or Oracle to make this work.  We can decompose our algorithm, and use a few key serialized objects to move data among parallel processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have an XPL implementation, we could use that instead of the shell.  The point is to leverage concurrent processing in a portable, flexible way.  We can avoid the details of API calls (and PL/SQL) while improving throughput in an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Tools were non-existent, and even a civilized practice like unit testing didn't really exist.  Now that we have test driven development, I think we can apply this to reverse engineering the billions of lines of legacy software that still exist in our application portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things to watch out for, however.  Top on the list is trying to recover meaning from code which is intentionally obscure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-dark-ages"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Dark Ages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the dark ages, we had programs written in assembler that did something of value, and the customer wanted a COBOL program.  Sometimes we had RPG applications that needed to be turned into COBOL.  Once, I even looked at some APL code that needed to be turned into COBOL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of assembler, where there are no real rules imposed by the language, it wasn't possible to consider any kind of syntactic transformation to COBOL.  Assembler programs (like it's bastard child, C) could directly manipulate pointers and do awful things.  Of course, assembler programs could (and did) modify themselves at run-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a translation from a semantically rich language to a poor language.  You could say &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;  in assembler.  In COBOL, you only had a limited subset of available language constructs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy of choice was &lt;strong&gt;Semantic Transformation&lt;/strong&gt;.  Get a grip on the program's purpose and means, describe that in clear English, and then write that in COBOL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rpg-and-apl"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RPG and APL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For languages like RPG or APL, the language itself implies some powerful, but implicit algorithms.  In this case, the language was semantically limited -- you didn't have to say much -- but the meaning of each statement (or expression) was deep.  Writing COBOL programs was translating from a semantically deep language to a semantically shallow language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, there were opportunities for &lt;strong&gt;Syntactic Transformation&lt;/strong&gt;.  RPG programs (especially old RPG and RPG II) could be rewritten into a COBOL-like syntax.  A great deal of fixed program structure had to be wired in around this transliterated RPG and it never covered all the cases well, but it got you started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of APL, it was purely a &lt;strong&gt;Semantic Transformation&lt;/strong&gt;  exercise.  The APL had to be read (and understood) in order to reason out what the COBOL was supposed to do.  Sadly, APL is a WORN (write-once-read-never) language, so this reverse engineering effort (had we won the bid) would have been epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="from-c-to-shining-java"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From C to Shining Java&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent reverse engineering exercises have been from the semantically rich language, C, to the semantically poor, but deep language, Java.  There are many C-isms that don't translate to Java.  While the syntax is similar, that's should be looked at as little more than coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn't sensible to attempt a syntactic transformation, since that obviates any value that Java creates.  Without understanding the semantics and creating some kind of object model, Java isn't really very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to construct proper Java objects, we need to pull out the relevant bits of C, merge them into a candidate object design, and then validate that design.  Clearly, a unit test is just what the doctor ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="driven-by-testing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Driven By Testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit testing is a wonderful way to get a sense of incremental accomplishment.  As pieces of C program are rewritten into Java, a set of unit tests demonstrate that it &amp;quot;works&amp;quot;.  We have to be cautious in this assessment, however, since some C programming is hideously obscure.  A recent example (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2007_10_19-obscure_c_isms_and_how_to_find_them.html"&gt;Obscure C-isms and How to Find Them&lt;/a&gt; ) was a humbling few hours of pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the sequence.  We're writing code first, then fitting unit tests around the extracted code, then refactoring the code.  Is this test driven?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguably, it isn't driven by testing.  We didn't fabricate a test scenario and fit code around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the process is driven by the need for testing.  Further, test driven development doesn't start with testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="test-driven-isn-t-test-first"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Test Driven isn't Test First&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test Driven Development starts with a little bit of preliminary design to create an API.  Given the preliminary API design, we start to craft some tests.  Often, I'll realize that the notional API isn't quite the thing, and refactor the tests to describe a slightly different API.  This process rarely goes through more than one iteration; it's a notional API until I start implementing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test did not come first.  It was a close second after the notional API that was going to be tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an initial implementation has been written, I'll often revisit the tests because the notional API is starting to look clumsy.  Generally, a round of early refactoring happens because there are too many objects being created or too many individual steps, or too few discrete objects for comfortable testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reverse engineering is only slightly different from development.  The principle difference is that I rarely start with a notional API, but rewrite the legacy code into the new Java.  Then come test cases, followed by the early round of refactoring to get the API to be sensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I claim that reverse engineering can be test driven.  It isn't dramatically different from development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This is a true, deeply horrible situation.  I was rescued by a reframing technique I'll call &lt;strong&gt;Extraction&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the function had nested if's without enough else's -- the kind of thing that handles two of the four possible conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
if( a ) {
    if …&lt;/pre&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is not a Python to the rescue story.  This is a true, deeply horrible situation.  I was rescued by a reframing technique I'll call &lt;strong&gt;Extraction&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;

    if( b ) {
        do something
    }
} else if( c ) {
    if( d ) {
       do something
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the other two conditions, (&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;  &amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;amp; !*b*) as well as (&lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;  &amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;amp; !*d*)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the function had double negatives.  It had the famous if(a == FALSE) kind thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="unit-test-hell"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unit Test Hell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I thought I had it, I wrote out the unit tests.  There are, with some analysis, 36 combinations of inputs.  The variable names, the context, the overall problem domain gave numerous hints as to what should happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it just didn't.  I couldn't get more than a few of the 36 cases to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I've got two problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can't reason out what the program does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm not sure I even have the unit tests correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="reframing-techniques"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reframing Techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my head starts getting a flat spot from beating it on the wall, there are a number of techniques I use for reframing the problem.  My favorite is &lt;strong&gt;Predicate Calculus&lt;/strong&gt;.  In this case, however, the conditions got complex and drifted too far from the essential semantics of the function.  It became a kind of algebra exercise, not giving me any insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;English Specification&lt;/strong&gt;  isn't a bad way to reframe things.  However, in this case, the English didn't make any sense either.  The C was just too obscure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt;, however, looked promising.  In a few minutes I had transliterated the C to Python, and had something that looked like it was producing meaningful results.  I revised the Python to write both a tidy .CSV summary as well as Java test case methods.  The CSV was a functional summary, the test case methods were cut and pasted into the Java TestCase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a Python to the rescue story.  The Python unit test cases didn't look really right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="reframing-through-extraction"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reframing Through Extraction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the user test cases arrived, it became painfully clear that my reverse engineering was not even close.  My glib and easy reframing techniques hadn't worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my back up against the wall, I pulled out the big gun in reverse engineering -- &lt;strong&gt;Extraction&lt;/strong&gt;.  I extracted this function and began to put together enough stuff to get it to compile and run in isolation.  This is time consuming and doesn't readily resolve semantic problems.  Once you have something running, you are rarely any closer to knowing what it meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolation, BTW, means complete isolation.  All dependencies (except for stdio.h) have to be resolved and the example has to fit in a single file.  There's nothing quite as clarifying as a one-file program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of doing &lt;strong&gt;Extraction&lt;/strong&gt;  is insight-producing.  The trick is to trust nothing.  First you pull out the function from the source file.  Then, when it won't compile, you start pulling things out of the various .h files and pasting them into the extraction.  After 20 minutes of cut and paste, I finally found the following nugget of pure evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
#define TRUE 0
#define FALSE -1
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="are-you-kidding"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Are You Kidding?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, apparently they were not kidding.  This clarified many things.  It made the if(a == FALSE) more clear.  It also pointed out many places where TRUE and 0 were used interchangably.  Inconsistency helped make it more obscure than it already was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making this substitution into the Python gave me test cases that made some sense.  This allowed me to rewrite the Java to at least work.  The resulting class includes a few &amp;quot;XXX - Refactor&amp;quot; comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I told the client what I'd learned, one of their programmers sent me the following link:  &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.web-hits.org/txt/codingunmaintainable.html"&gt;How to Write Unmaintainable Code&lt;/a&gt; .  Now that I'm past the most horrible part of the program, this is funny.  Down in the section titled &amp;quot;Miscellaneous Techniques&amp;quot;, item 11 is this exact technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's funnier (or scarier) is anyone allowing this through their QA procedures, putting it into production and using it for years.  Clearly, code inspections are not on anyone's to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Some vendors (Sun's Java CAPS) split collaboration and orchestration tiers.  I prefer to merge them, since I'm not positioning products to prevent overlap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the important quote: &amp;quot;orchestration itself is really about creating another layer of services that interact to form solutions, which is what SOA is all about&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This helped me realize the value of a SOA.  It isn't the services.  It's the collaboration among services at a higher level that reveals the value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if it's not about reuse, what do we measure to be sure we're actually delivering something of value?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="customer-conversation"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Customer Conversation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent customer conversation highlighted the reuse issue.  They were responding my &amp;quot;It's not reuse, it's agility&amp;quot; point.  They countered with the simple &amp;quot;of course it's reuse.&amp;quot;  And I had an epiphany at that moment.  I tried to dig in to understand their point and realized that reuse is impossible to measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Of course you can measure reuse,&amp;quot; they explained.  &amp;quot;You compare the actual project &lt;em&gt;vs.&lt;/em&gt; how it could have been without the reuse.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked &amp;quot;How do you measure the things you didn't build?  You're talking about measuring the things that aren't there.  Who counts the things &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;  built?  What criteria do they use?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-bentley-reuse-model"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Bentley Reuse Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's my reuse model.  I call it the Bentley Reuse Model (&lt;strong&gt;BRM&lt;/strong&gt;™).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll reuse my Subaru Impreza two-door coupe instead of having you buy me a new &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.carsdirect.com/2006/bentley/continental_gt"&gt;Bentley Continental&lt;/a&gt;  for this project.  That reuse is direct ROI that results from engaging me as an architect.  I'd like 1% of that ROI as a project completion bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like that, I have an even better reuse model.  It's the Team Bentley Reuse Model (&lt;strong&gt;TBRM&lt;/strong&gt;™).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every one of your IT staff (all 100 of 'em) will reuse their existing transportation options (cars, public transportation, car pooling, bicycles, whatever.)  Since you no longer have to buy 100 Bentleys, you will have saved a fortune through the reuse I created.  I want my 1% of that savings, which -- interetingly -- is a new Bentley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you give me the Bentley because I made everyone else reuse their transportation.  And since they're already using this transportation, there's minimal disruption to the established organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="where-s-the-new-functionality"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where's the New Functionality?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hair-splitting over reuse arrives with the &amp;quot;what new thing are we getting?&amp;quot; question.  It's hair-splitting because it still involves measuring something that didn't happen.  It involves creating a counter-factual argument:  &amp;quot;What if we could have written all this code that we didn't actually write?&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;What if pigs flew?&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;What if flying pigs wrote this smaller set of code instead of the big set of code we planned on writing?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fantasy is that some bundle of features stems directly from some volume of code at a ratio of 1:1.  [X] features are based on [Y] lines of code.  Through reuse we are somehow able to reduce the volume of code to [rY] where &lt;span class="formula"&gt;&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 1&lt;/span&gt;, giving us some new relationship between code and features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fantasy because -- of course -- we can't ever estimate the amount of code required to deliver any specific feature.  Some features may be available through training of the users.  A feature may be a consequence of using the right framework or the right persistence/ORM tool.  Some features are emergent consequences of other engineering choices.  Is this &amp;quot;reuse&amp;quot; or is this a simple consequence of good engineering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn't a framework reuse?  Isn't a database reuse?  What about xalan?  If we use XSLT based on Xalan, that's reuse, isn't it?  Isn't an operating system a kind of reuse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How should we credit our project managers with the technological insight to use an OS, database, framework, or open source project?  Perhaps reuse is too hard to measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="measuring-things"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Measuring Things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuse is a comparison between a potentially dumb development effort and an actually less dumb development effort.  I reject the very idea that a dumb plan is a valid thing to measure.  We need to measure actual things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can't measure reuse, what can we measure?  Can we measure agility?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we can measure agility by looking at our historical trend of delivering features through time and at the expenditure of dollars.  Forget code and forget reuse.  How long does it take to enable users with a feature?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A SOA architecture can put features into the user's hands quicker than a non-SOA architecture.  Here's Linthicum's take: &amp;quot;Orchestration, in context to a SOA, is strategic, leveraging business rules to determine how systems should interact and better leverage the business value from each system through a common abstract business model.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we use our SOA framework and tools to assemble a usable application out of services, then we've built something quickly.  We can be agile since we aren't rewriting fundamental services to implement a business change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="reuse-did-happen"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reuse Did Happen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, reuse of the services &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;  happen.  I never said it wouldn't.  But, we can't measure the ROI of that reuse.  Therefore, we're not going to try and leverage that reuse as the central value proposition for SOA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can measure the ROI of agility, since we put features into the hands of users.  It's the business value of those features that are the value of SOA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kontrawize.blogs.com/kontrawize/"&gt;Kontrawize&lt;/a&gt;  says:  &amp;quot;there is only something to gain with SOA for the parts of your software that genuinely have re-usable functionality, and are expected to be re-used in the shorter term.&amp;quot;  Further, &amp;quot;in some circumstances it won't win you anything, and could cost you more to implement.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reuse potential of an SOA is the core issue.  We wrestle with it constantly.  I don't know where the SOA = Reuse came from, but it's certainly a strong feeling.  When I Google &amp;quot;SOA Reuse&amp;quot; I get a score or more of hits on why SOA ≠ Reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how to tackle the SOA = Reuse problem, either.  Generally, we remind our customers that SOA isn't about reuse, &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;.  Reuse can happen, which is good, but it requires a disruptive change in software development and IT governance.  Rather than tackle that, we'd just like to solve your business problems quickly and simply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-point-of-services"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point of Services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We try to sell SOA services based on Agility.  Since an overall composite application can be decomposed into loosely-coupled services and some flexible collaborations among those services, we should be able to rework the application cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a big should, however.  If we aren't careful, we can embed business rules in the wrong piece of the architecture.  There's a central principle, here, that gets us to cheaper and simpler.  I call it &lt;strong&gt;Allocation of Responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2005_09_18-essay_14_mutability_analysis.html"&gt;spectrum of mutability&lt;/a&gt;  in any application.  It works like this: some parts of an application are based on laws (political or natural) and are unlikely to ever change.  These must be services.  Some parts of an application are based on the overall industry or the organization of the company.  These don't change much either, and must be services, also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things are local to a line of business, a product, customer, vendor or even a specific contract.  These are things which vary, and may not make good candidates for services.  These are the kinds of special cases that catastrophically break application software.  These are the things that we need to put in scripts or collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="services-aren-t-mutable"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Services Aren't Mutable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central tenet is that faster and simpler flow from having some fixed services, defined clearly and plainly without too many odd special cases.  These are easy to write, and very easy to get into production.  The users should be able to cough out standard test cases for the standard situations without burning many brain calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exceptions, oh-by-the-ways, alternative courses, and extensions, however, take a bit longer to craft.  Often, these are best handled in a collaboration or higher-level application.  These components will rely on the fundamental service, but add value by handling a unique oddness correctly.  We rarely (if ever) have all the answers for these special cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, one of the causes of &amp;quot;scope creep&amp;quot; (in the negative sense) and subsequent project cancellation is IT's inability to deal with ongoing flux in the business.  Each time some executive works out a new, bigger, more bizarre contract, IT learns one of two lessons in agility: how to respond or how to dig in and refuse to cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-prevent-change-defense"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Prevent Change Defense&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IT project managers are penalized for permitting change.  Consequently, IT departments can build really effective prevent-change defensive strategies.  Often, complex &amp;quot;gatekeeping&amp;quot; exercises, scope statements, project reviews, program offices and other management shackles are used to prevent change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We penalize IT many ways.  First, our terminology indicates our preferences.  &amp;quot;Scope Creep&amp;quot; is pejorative: it's a failure.  Everyone wants to know the final, total price and the deadline date.  Any change -- any change at all -- is greeted badly.  If you reduce the cost, then your initial estimate was sand-bagging and you're a useless liar.  If you increase the cost, then your initial estimate was just a psych-bid to win the work, now you'll make up the difference with endless change control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since users often add features during the life of a project, the budget will always grow.  Even if we play the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.xprogramming.com/xpmag/whatisxp.htm"&gt;XP Planning Game&lt;/a&gt; , we only adjust the priorities and the order in which work gets done.  We never balance or contract the budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Project Growth = Bad.  Therefore, we put as many obstacles in place to prevent the users from learning or changing.  Once the project starts, it's like water flowing down a series of waterfalls... You know the metaphor: it can't be diverted or changed, you can't add to or subtract from it.  The initial specification is the only specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="responding-to-change"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Responding to Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we elect to respond positively to change, we have to fundamentally rethink the ways we measure project management.  Blind and stupid measures (&amp;quot;on time&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;under budget&amp;quot;) tell us nothing about what the users got out of the deal.  We need to look at what got delivered that people used.  What made a difference in the business?  What business value did we enable through software?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider putting some services in place which handle the 80% cases, and using those services in some applications.  We build the simplest, dumbest cases first.  We can usually build this very, very quickly because we already know this about the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next 20% has to be considered very carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it subject to change?  Stable features of the business are more valuable than changeable features.  Rather than program the living daylights out of something, expose it as a well-thought out manual operation and be done with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it have growth potential?  A feature of the business that users (executives, vendors, customers, etc.) like will be used more heavily in the future.  Perhaps this defines a new service to capture the next 16% (80% of last 20%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it a significant change from what we have in place?  Does it lead to devastating software changes?  This happens when something about the business model was encoded badly in software, and became a feature of the business.  Often the software and the business are conflated into the user's mental model of what can be done and what can't be done.  Anyone who starts thinking outside the box will force us to rethink this.  Why should cruddy software limit what the business can and cannot do?  And why should IT be enforcing that cruddy view of the business?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="resulting-architecture"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Resulting Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The architecture that results from an SOA exercise will be simpler because we have the opportunity to practice &lt;strong&gt;Allocation of Responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;.  The immutable features of the application are the core services.  We may write these or we may make use of our vendor's API's; either way, we have a base set of features that don't change much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These services are supplemented with collaborations that fill in the special cases.  Perhaps they choose between two services to manage the 80-20 general case-exceptional case processing.  In some cases, the collaborations may actually implement the special case because it's too specialized or mutable or depreciable to require a stable service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the big value of SOA is in allow us to pursue an Agile methodology.  We want to have frequent releases, learn our lessons quickly, and adjust as we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to value change, not revile it.  We want to measure our success in business impact, not budget and schedule.  (People say &amp;quot;in the real world, we still have a fixed budget&amp;quot; as a way of playing their favorite prevent defense.  An agile approach doesn't spend more; at the worst, it spends the same amount incrementally, permitting change.  By welcoming change, however, it can spend less.  In the real world, the users change their minds.  Picking a schedule today for software that won't into production for two more years is insanity.  Rewarding managers for adhering to an insane schedule is, well, even less sane.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="drop-reuse-pick-up-cheap"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drop Reuse.  Pick up Cheap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My position is this: use SOA to reduce the complexity of your software.  Rather than big programs, write small collaborations that implement special cases on top of the general-case services.  A good &lt;strong&gt;Allocation of Responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;  will simplify your software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

In this case, it appears to be 30-50% of the original C code is stuff that is available in Java and can be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's interesting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's interesting is a vague outline of &lt;strong&gt;How to Deconstruct C&lt;/strong&gt;.  Further, it's a story of &lt;strong&gt;Python to the Rescue&lt;/strong&gt;, even though the goal is to write Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a bottom-up view.  If the C program is reasonably well-written, each individual file will be a class-like module.  In some cases, the file will be more like a Python module or Java package: it will have a smattering of closely-related data structure and processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a front-to-back view.  However, you can't really begin at the beginning, because the setup and initialization is often badly uncoupled from the processing it initializes.  You can, however, start reading the program at the end and work out some of the preconditions that have to exist for each statement to make sense.  You can, if the program is not pathologically poorly-written, arrive at a pleasant overview that makes some sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should eventually discover some essential data structure.  &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Structured_Programming"&gt;Jackson Structured Programming&lt;/a&gt;  builds programs around the transformation of one data structure into another; this is the basic principle behind a well-designed set of XSL transformations.  It is also the heart of most batch programs -- transform the source records into output records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The really hard part is locating the record types in a procedural program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="finding-the-central-loop"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding the Central Loop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the program had a very complex outline.  There was an &amp;quot;essential&amp;quot; loop, however, that was buried under the complexity.  I found it helpful to ask &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;What's The Business Value?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;  when confronted with another hideous C function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the business records were aggregated into batches.  There was a long, complex preparation which created temporary tables and result tables.  A rather complex query-insert process populated the temporary tables.  Indexes were added, and the database's analysis procedures executed.  None of this created obvious business value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually it became clear that there was a loop that did the relevant processing on rows within a batch.  Now we're getting somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="order-n-squared"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Order N-Squared&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the central loop was actually two nested loops, created an O(n²) kind of process.  Yes, there was a sort, but each row was compared to each row after it in the collection.  So row 1 was compared to all rows 2 through &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, this can't be optimal.  I suspect that what this program really does can be transformed into an order &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;  log(&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;) operation that uses two passes.  The first pass builds a few useful hashmaps, the second pass then does the final, interesting algorithm.  However, at this point, it's hard to prove that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we'd uncovered the two inner loops, we had a picture of the overall structure.  However, we weren't really close to anything useful yet.  We haven't uncovered any fundamental objects or classes, just some algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="cryptic-class-definitions-parallel-arrays"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cryptic Class Definitions: Parallel Arrays&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the things being processed in these two loops are the central objects of the application.  In a reasonable C program, you'd expect the objects to be part of a proper C-language type or structure declaration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, because of the batch-processing overheads, this program used &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/appdev.111/b28395/oci05bnd.htm#insertedID5"&gt;Oracle array fetches&lt;/a&gt; .  It didn't have a proper record structure.  It did, however, have dozens of parallel arrays.  This was -- in effect -- a kind of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;List&amp;lt;BusinessRecord&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; structure.  With a bunch of assumptions, we could construct the effective class definition for these central objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original array fetches can be replaced some simpler processing to load POJO's rather than dozen of parallel arrays.  The various layers of batch management overhead can be stripped away and the program pared down to the single function which does the real work.  Once we knew what we were looking at, we found the function did the array fetch and executed two nested loops to process all of the objects in the array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we could put our first unit tests together.  That's real progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-to-the-rescue"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Python To The Rescue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our target was Java.  However, that still leaves a need for tools.  Specifically, we had a pile of SQL which implied some table structures.  The customer had some idea what those tables looked like, but didn't have the actual DDL to create the tables.  (They never seem to keep this or put it under configuration control.  Why not?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I spent a pleasant half-hour typing up a version of the DDL.  Rather than simply make a script, however, I made some small SQLAlchemy programs to create the database, load some randomly generated test data, and do some basic reporting.  This is all too painful in Java, but trivial in state-of-the-art tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="business-rules"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Business Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program's parameter files were used to build two sophisticated ancillary data structures.  In effect, the parameters encoded two sets of business rules.  Half of the &amp;quot;parameter parsing&amp;quot; section of the program merely built these structures out of the INI files.  Somehow, the rules where used in the main loops to do the processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program did three separate things, each of which had an INI file.  These INI files, in turn included some general INI parameter settings.  We could partition the INI material into two parts: standard property-setting, and business rule definitions.  The property-setting stuff is garden-variety Java property processing; the associated C code to parse properties is no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After peeling them out of the INI files, the business rule definitions formed a kind of declarative language.  This little declarative language built two families of rules, each of which had distinct sets of keywords, options and parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules had first-class C type definitions.  The attributes of the class could be identified.  What about the methods?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business rules are -- universally -- examples of the &lt;strong&gt;Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;  design pattern.  That means that each rule embodies some unique processing.  While each rule in the C program was a simple structure with a half-dozen fields, it also had some method buried inside it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little grepping of the source turned up a series of functions with similar names, each of which had a pointer to a rule field as an argument.  We found this kind of parallelism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
someFuncA( ruleFieldA *arg, other args )
someFuncB( ruleFieldB *arg, other args )
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This clarified things considerably.  It told us that a rule was merely a &lt;strong&gt;Façade&lt;/strong&gt;  or &lt;strong&gt;Container&lt;/strong&gt;  for a set of individual Strategy objects.  Each &amp;quot;field&amp;quot; of the original rule definition was really a &lt;strong&gt;Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;  object, and the rule was just a container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unveiled dozens of strategy class definitions which were knit together in these rule containers.  This, also, lead to a cool Pythonic design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pythonic-initialization"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pythonic Initialization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the cooler Python techniques is to use basic Python class and object definitions to create a Domain Specific Language (DSL) using Python syntax.  Projects like Django's data model and SQLAlchemy show elegant ways to use Python syntax to create a DSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our goal was Java, it's so much quicker and easier to prototype the design in Python.  In a few minutes -- seriously, minutes -- I had enough Python class definitions to demonstrate that we could trivially transform the INI files into Python or Java object definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part was replacing INI files and the associated parsing with first-class Java (or Python) as the source language.  The user-facing initialization file would have things like &amp;quot;[section]&amp;quot; replaced with &amp;quot;rules= {&amp;quot;, plus a few extra commas.  Except for a little required boilerplate code at the beginning and end, it would be identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Pythonistas, for inventing such a cool declaratory style of Python programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="more-unit-testing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Unit Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we decoded the rules as a bunch of largely static initialization, we could turn to the method hidden down inside each individual rule.  We examined each of the someFuncA and someFuncB rule-specific processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we were nearing the heart of what was going on in this program.  There were about half a dozen of these rule-specific methods that had to be unwound into a forest of &lt;strong&gt;Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;  class hierarchies.  Each &lt;strong&gt;Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;  class hierarchy needed a proper set of unit tests to validate the precise business rule that it implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="flags-and-classes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flags and Classes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flag settings have lots of interpretations.  They might be dynamic &lt;strong&gt;States&lt;/strong&gt;  or they might be static &lt;strong&gt;Strategies&lt;/strong&gt;.  Either way, a flag -- even a boolean flag -- is often a class definition; it is rarely a simple boolean value.  A flag with enumerated values usually identifies a family of related subclasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If-statements to test flags have to be looked at as potentially polymorphic methods of the implied subclasses.  In our case, there were parallel function names that made the polymorphism more obvious.  However, rotten choice of function names can conceal the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often we get to do &lt;strong&gt;If-Statement Hoisting&lt;/strong&gt;.  Once we've elected to transform a flag into a class, we'll find if-statements which are now needless class membership tests.  For example, down deep within someFuncA will be an if-statement that asks if the rule has the ruleFlavorA flag set.  Once we make the rule flavors into classes, each class has a unique implementation of someFunc, and a test for class membership go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In effect, the if statement is hoisted out of the function and moved forward in the algorithm.  The test becomes part of initial rule object construction.  This is an optimization that is very elegant.  Rather than execute the if statement for every one of the &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;² record processing steps, we execute the if statement one during initialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="globals-and-integration"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Globals and Integration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest problems with converting C programs is the reliance on global variables.  The global variables make the scope of every function suddenly murky.  In a reasonably well-written program, there will be few globals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parameters and properties, clearly, need to be global.  Often, a static class can be used to implement a kind of &lt;strong&gt;Singleton&lt;/strong&gt;  for this.  In other cases, we can provide the parameter object to various objects within the program, eliminating the little bit of semantic confusion that purely static classes can raise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we uncovered one bothersome situation where a deeply-buried business rule method made an appeal to a global variable.  A little reflection, however, made this less bothersome.  A business rule executes in a &amp;quot;context&amp;quot; of global parameter settings.  In this case, the context included some alternative business rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An open issue is whether this context was an attribute of the object, or a parameter to the business rule's method.  This is almost a matter of preference.  Method function parameters can always be turned into object properties.  However, there's usually some semantic behind the attributes.  We have to return to our initial question, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;What's the Business Value?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; for guidance in the parameter vs. attribute question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn't take too much refactoring to provide the necessary context to the rules.  Since we were building unit tests, it was easy to move things around and rerun the tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="allocating-responsibility"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Allocating Responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we arrive at the actual heart of the matter.  What is each class responsible for?  The original C functions have several dispositions.  Either they're junk and get removed, or they're available in Java and get replaced.  What's left has to become a method of some class.  Where do we place the C functions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classes we've identified to this point will fall into two groups: passive classes, which are dominated by attributes, getters and setters; and active classes, which are dominated by complex methods.  The distinction is a little subjective and it will change as the deconstruction proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These more passive classes will become Java Beans.  Often this is clear because the class is persisted, or is merely an item in a collection.  The more active classes will usually become the new application program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most C functions have a mixture of arguments and global variables as inputs and outputs.  It helps to make an attempt to characterize the implied inputs and outputs of each C function.  The assignment statements define the state changes.  In some cases, this will lead to an obvious partitioning of C functions around their effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, it is clear that a function is a method of a class because it updates attributes of that class.  However, a C function can have so many effects and side effects that the fog is nearly impenetrable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One indicator is the parameters to the function.  For example, a function which uses one of our &lt;strong&gt;Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;  classes as an argument is probably a method of that strategy class.  Similarly, when we deconstructed dynamic flags into a &lt;strong&gt;State&lt;/strong&gt;  design pattern, all of the functions with if-statements based on the state settings are likely methods of the state subclasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, a strategy method will imply methods in one of the &amp;quot;passive&amp;quot; bean classes.  We may see several functions do similar processing on a bean class.  The similarity should be noted with a //TODO comment.  Later, the to do list can be examined for opportunities to refactor the similar-looking processing out of the strategy and into the bean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="things-to-look-for"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things to Look For&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the start of &lt;strong&gt;Finding The Objects&lt;/strong&gt;  (FTO™) in C Programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proper structures are the usual suspects for finding class definitions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A union defines peer classes with a common superclass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A C source file may be a class definition.  Does it provide operations for a common set of attributes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A parallel set of arrays may hide a class definition.  Are the arrays indexed by the same value?  Functions with apply to one or more parallel arrays may be methods of the implied class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A flag (either boolean or with an enumerated set of values) may be a peer subclass discriminator.  The various if-statements to test this flag may be replaced by polymorphic methods of a family of subclasses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Globals merely serve to muddy the water.  In some cases, a variable is global out of pure laziness; it has a narrow scope.  In other cases, a global is used in enough different scopes that it is clearly an implied attribute of some objects, or is an implied parameter to method functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State changes -- assignment statements -- provide some hint on where responsibility belongs.  In many cases, a C function will do too much and must be decomposed into methods of distinct classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it's easier to create test data and mess around in the database using SQLAlchemy.  It leaves a processing trail.  With Python helper programs and scripts we can reload the test database, do performance testing and do integration testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the Pythonic world-view gives us hints as to how we can eliminate programming in favor of declaration.  Rather than parse INI syntax, just write a readable object or class definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, we can dry-run object designs in Python far more quickly and simply than we can in Java.  Once it seems to work, we can add the necessary Java overheads to make it statically correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, we're not done.  I don't have final metrics yet for a C-to-Java transformation.  Indeed, we're still waiting on the client.  However, we think we'll cut the program down to a third of it's original size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I went to a meeting, the responsibility was duly handed off to me.  &amp;quot;Alex has it mostly done, you just need to pitch in and help finish this by Friday.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What I knew was this: I had a program, and I was supposed to make it work.  I went to a meeting, the responsibility was duly handed off to me.  &amp;quot;Alex has it mostly done, you just need to pitch in and help finish this by Friday.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened, patiently, hoping to get some sense of what it was supposed to do.  Eventually, it became clear that it was supposed to read a file, write a file and put stuff into a database.  It imported some fancy classes from elsewhere in the enterprise that created some new fields in the records of the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-is-the-result"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Is The Result?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider persistence to be more-or-less sacred.  You have to take it very, very seriously.  This program wrote a record &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt;  inserted it into a database.  Was this just dumb belt-and-suspenders stuff?  Did they not trust the database?  Or, did was the file used by some other application, separate from the database?  Both ideas made me crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it was belt-and-suspenders, they needed to think carefully about their database choices.  If you can't trust a database, why use it for mission-critical data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the data went both to the database and to other applications that couldn't connect to the database, they needed to think carefully about their database choices.  If you can't use a database, why are we putting data into it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program produced two outputs, which could -- under fairly ordinary circumstances -- be shown to be different.  All you have to do is a re-run and the database timestamps may not match the filesystem timestamps.  What does &amp;quot;works&amp;quot; mean when you can easily doubt the results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="some-testing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program was small, and a few of the classes had tests.  I've learned (in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2006_08_04-tools_arent_the_answer.html"&gt;Tools Aren't the Answer&lt;/a&gt; ) that even abstract superclasses and interfaces need test cases.  So, I'd have to add those to the test suite to be sure that things really &amp;quot;worked&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, most of the program was piled into the class with public static void main in it.  This is typical clumsy design.  It makes a bunch of interesting parts of the program static, and forces them into one method, main, which is famously hard to reuse.  The main method has an interface that's often difficult to live with.  Who wants to make a properties file just to call the method named &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; of some other class.  Why not just call well-defined interface methods?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this main program is a royal pain to write unit tests for.  Of course, there were none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="documentation"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part about this is the lack of usable documentation. There were no documented requirements, and no overall design.  There was word-of-mouth and code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I demanded a written specification.  The customer called a meeting.  I said that I didn't work well with oral requirements; I needed something written.  Their leadership called our Account Executive to cuss me out for requiring things in writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Account Executive told me that I was being even more of a jerk than usual by asking for written specifications.  I reminded the AE that verbal requirements are merely an opening for &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability"&gt;plausible deniability&lt;/a&gt; .  I could already hear the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Them: &amp;quot;You bums didn't get our software to work on time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Us:  &amp;quot;What do you mean by 'work'?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Them:  &amp;quot;Idiots!  You went to the meetings.  You should know.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Us:  &amp;quot;You're right, obviously.  We think it works.  Our recollection of the meetings tells us it works.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Them:  &amp;quot;But it doesn't.  It doesn't do [X]&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Us:  &amp;quot;I don't recall that being discussed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn't make for a good relationship with a client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="preventing-disaster"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preventing Disaster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would prefer to prevent the whole debacle.  But how do you ask for reasonably clear specifications when they clearly refuse to write things down?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;I need to know what it does.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Them: &amp;quot;We'll tell you during testing when it doesn't work.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;How about you tell me now?  That would prevent waiting until test time to learn what it was supposed to do.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Them: &amp;quot;We can't.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Okay.  Imagine that it failed a test.  What is the most important test?  What would be the biggest mistake on my part.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Them:  &amp;quot;Not meeting the deadline date.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="structural-issues"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Structural Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No specifications.  A structure unsuited for unit testing.  Incomplete unit tests.  Both file and database outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's just the beginning.  The first week we were told that there's a central stored procedure call.  The procedure hasn't been written, doesn't have a defined API, but it is central.  We were also told the procedure had existed for a long time.  It either didn't exist or did; either way, no one could provide us an API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we found that the procedure returns a result set of multiple rows.  This is a devastating change to the cardinalities already written into the program.  The program assumed a kind of 1 row in-1 row out process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that it's more like the following:  A cluster of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;  related rows come in; a common attribute is used to execute a stored procedure which returns a result set of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;  related pieces of data.  Somehow the &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;  rows in the result set are correlated with the &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;  input rows.  What if the cardinalities differ?  Arrgh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="can-anything-good-come-of-this"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can Anything Good Come Of This?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We get something to &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; on time.&lt;/strong&gt;
They hate us forever because we weren't up to the task, and only their constant nagging made the thing work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We get something to &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; after the deadline.&lt;/strong&gt;
They hate us forever because we didn't make the date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We get something that almost &amp;quot;works&amp;quot; by the deadline.&lt;/strong&gt;
They hate us forever because they have to think about what actually matters in this application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We give up now.&lt;/strong&gt;
They hate us forever for not even trying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;our company's&lt;/em&gt;  approach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has anyone generated succinct flyers or white papers?
I’m lost in a Google-lanche of info, and I dearly want to narrow the
focus a bit before I have to explain it to &lt;em&gt;VP's&lt;/em&gt;  and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-sized-company"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Sized Company?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TC's an architect, so he's asking about selling something that we'll develop, install and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SOA is for every size of company.  Developing applications with an SOA is cheaper and
simpler than traditional &amp;quot;wholistic&amp;quot; apps that don’t have
clearly defined services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?  Simplicty.  Services force you to think about agility and
simplicity.  The result can be software which is simpler, cheaper and more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve the required agility requires you to pare things down to their essence and then build that essential service.  The more traditional approach is to gatther a bunch of requirements and design a bunch of software.  At no point in the process does anyone ask you to simplify those requirements or the resulting software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-are-you-trying-to-sell"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Are You Trying to Sell?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, there are two parts to this, because there are two things you can sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. You can sell the technology as an end in itself.  For example, when the customer wants
to use it and you’re the expert.  We're doing some of this for customers who want to build in-house skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. You can sell the technology as an end in itself.  For example, when the customer wants
to use it and you’re the expert.  We're doing some of this for customers who want to build in-house skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. You can use the technology as a means to an end.  This, I think, is where you are coming from.   The customer
wants an app -- a solution to a business problem -- and you are going to use an SOA framework to save yourself considerable agony.   Much of
the glue that takes time to specify, build and test is now part of
most SOA frameworks.  Generally, the customer could care less
whether it comes from a vendor or you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. You can sell the technology as an end in itself.  For example, when the customer wants
to use it and you’re the expert.  We're doing some of this for customers who want to build in-house skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider applications for which we have extensive proprietary source.  We could convert our code to a SOA framework (for example &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sun.com/software/javaenterprisesystem/javacaps/index.jsp"&gt;Sun's JCAPS&lt;/a&gt; ).  Our apps would work
the same, but the overall installation is MUCH smaller and simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. You can sell the technology as an end in itself.  For example, when the customer wants
to use it and you’re the expert.  We're doing some of this for customers who want to build in-house skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="culture-a-k-a-governance"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Culture (a/k/a Governance)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. You can sell the technology as an end in itself.  For example, when the customer wants
to use it and you’re the expert.  We're doing some of this for customers who want to build in-house skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The culture of
the developers must precede the implementation.  If they don't get the SOA viewpoint, then you can't build an SOA application.  What's important is separating the final &amp;quot;to the user&amp;quot; presentation, the composite workflows and the underlying services.  In many cases -- particularly where schedules are golden -- managers will undermine the SOA work by insisting that some piece of user interface be completed RIGHT NOW, irrespective of how it devastates the architecture.  Serious, essential business functionality cut and pasted into several JSP pages leaps to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. You can sell the technology as an end in itself.  For example, when the customer wants
to use it and you’re the expert.  We're doing some of this for customers who want to build in-house skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some places are brain-dead.  I blogged a specific quote in &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2006_09_30-why_soa_is_doa_in_some_organizations.html"&gt;SOA is DOA&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. You can sell the technology as an end in itself.  For example, when the customer wants
to use it and you’re the expert.  We're doing some of this for customers who want to build in-house skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culture of the customer is a “don’t
care” item if you are using SOA to build a solution.  If the customer is clueless and you’ve built a working solution, the orientation of the architecture doesn't matter.  It could be service oriented, object oriented or aspect oriented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. You can sell the technology as an end in itself.  For example, when the customer wants
to use it and you’re the expert.  We're doing some of this for customers who want to build in-house skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you're trying to
teach them SOA, it had best be strategic for them.  Otherwise, the mentoring will be immediately trumped by management.  &amp;quot;It's taking too long to write the use cases,&amp;quot; for example, will subvert everything by undoing the training and coaching you've done for the first few weeks of the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this month's CACM, the article on …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Centuries ago -- it seems -- Jim Coplien facilitated a session for us at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hillside.net/chiliplop/"&gt;ChiliPLoP&lt;/a&gt; .  Eventually, I figured out that patterns are a solution to a problem in a context which resolves various alternative forces, and has some understood consequences.  Context - Problem - Forces - Solution - Consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this month's CACM, the article on &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1278201.1278206&amp;amp;coll=portal&amp;amp;dl=ACM&amp;amp;idx=1278201&amp;amp;part=periodical&amp;amp;WantType=periodical&amp;amp;title=Communications%20of%20the%20ACM&amp;amp;CFID=26238735&amp;amp;CFTOKEN=67485512"&gt;Involving Top Management In IT Projects&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot; describes a technique called &lt;em&gt;Problem Mapping&lt;/em&gt;.  Wow!  I think this is the other side of the pattern coin.  The article's a tough read -- it requires careful study because it makes a rigorous philosophical argument about the nature of truth in requirements analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that too many people jump past the problem, past the requirements, straight into design.  I complained about this recently in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2007_08_05-use_cases_why_cases_and_the_bentley_test.html"&gt;Use Cases, Why Cases and the Bentley Test&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Problem Mapping thing may be just what's required to stop the blind leap into specifying a solution before the problem is really understood.  The technique is gloriously simple, and requires three relatively simple steps: gathering, organizing and criticizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="three-step-process"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Three Step Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gathering is what analysts and consultants do anyway.  Interview people, read code, find the problem, document the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the organizing phase, the real magic happens.  Your findings are partitioned into four buckets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problems and Needs.&lt;/strong&gt;   These are the going-in problems or organizational needs.  Things don't work, or don't work well.  Things are complex, expensive, risky, error-prone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Causes.&lt;/strong&gt;  These are the answers to &amp;quot;Why does this problem exist?&amp;quot;  This is critical, and often under-documented.  There's a chain of root-cause analysis that leads to things like &amp;quot;That's just the way it is&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Darned if I know why&amp;quot;.  The whole root-cause analysis isn't as important as separating problems from causes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consequences.&lt;/strong&gt;   These are the consequences of the problem.  If something's complex, expensive, risky or error-prone, what's wrong with that?  What's the consequence to the enterprise of something being complex?  Complexity -- in and of itself -- isn't a problem; but it can have consequences that include cost, risk, time, pain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suggested Solutions.&lt;/strong&gt;   This is the part that can now be set aside.  Without this four-part map, the solutions get muddied in with everything else.  With this problem map, they can be neatly set aside for what they're worth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="calling-the-baby-ugly"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Calling the Baby Ugly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final, criticizing, step is where we bring the interviewees together to learn what the consultants learned.  The point is to achieve a common organizational understanding.  There will be pain involved.  One person's problem may point a finger at someone else's cause.  You can't call someone's baby ugly without the situation becoming tense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, change involves perception of a problem, which can be stressful.  It also requires disruption of the bad situation; disruption by itself is stressful, even if the outcome is better for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, this technique coaches everyone in the essential logic of causality.  Something's broken, that breakage has a cause and consequences.  Will the solution actually address the breakage?  Would addressing the cause be smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="follow-up"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Follow-Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've fumbled around with something a little bit like this.  I didn't have the clear-headed approach that Simonsen describes.  I merely tried to separate problem, cause and solution so that I could keep folks from implementing their favorite technology when it wouldn't actually help solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it helpful to recast the lessons learned in the Pattern mold.  Document the Context, Problem, Forces, Solution and Consequences to capture the information in a concise, story-like format.  When you have a problem in a context, it's like reading a screenplay.  The second act of the screenplay -- the forces -- is where the conflict plays out.  The solution and consequences are the third act of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having an arc makes the whole something we can understand and use.  It makes it possible for top management to articulate the reasons for the technology solution and maintain some focus and follow-through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've seen requirements done badly.

&lt;p&gt;I've seen requirements done badly.  I've seen some notable failures of the use case technique: almost entirely because people refuse to actually apply the technique; they refuse to write use cases from the actor's point of view.  I've whined about this before in Notable Failures of Use Cases, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2005_10_26-notable_failure_of_use_cases.html"&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2005_10_28-notable_failure_of_use_cases_part_2.html"&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2005_10_31-notable_failure_of_use_cases_part_3.html"&gt;part 3&lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2006_04_28-notable_failure_of_use_cases_part_4.html"&gt;part 4&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting point that Wiegers makes is that there are different species of requirements.  Failing to recognize this is what can lead to diluting the use cases with junk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summary definition (from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.coyotevalley.com/tools.htm"&gt;Coyote Valley Software&lt;/a&gt;  principal Brian Lawrence) appears to be that the line between requirements and design is that requirements lead to design choices.  While I like this, it has to be refined a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressman calls this the &amp;quot;What vs. How&amp;quot; distinction.  Requirements specify what must happen.  Design chooses how this will happen.  Again, this needs some refinement.  In a way, Pressman throws up his hands in despair, noting only that there is a hierarchy of what's and how's.  For example, interface requirements are &amp;quot;how&amp;quot; we'll implement some business requirement.  On the other hand, the interface requirements are a &amp;quot;what&amp;quot; to a lower-level piece of software that opens and closes sockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exacerbating this hierarchy problem is more fundamental confusion on techniques to capture requirements in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="point-of-view"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Point of View&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently we were working through some use cases where the author had identified a document as the actor.  The body of the use case was a bunch of technical processing details for the document.  It's painful to claim that all 20 use cases weren't use cases because the actual actor (the user who needed to see the document's processing) was never mentioned even once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, the customer trotted out a use case with no actor.  The use case summary had a passive-voice construction (&amp;quot;will be notified&amp;quot;)  At that point I could drop the bomb that use case actors are usually people (sometimes they are interfaces) by asking &amp;quot;for whom?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The customer's project manager made the claim that he thought that use cases were written from the system's point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="technical-requirements"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;quot;Technical&amp;quot; Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told the customer's team that it was a common misconception.  It arises because of the vast wealth of technical details with no obvious home when writing use cases.  They wanted to call the details &amp;quot;technical requirements&amp;quot;.  I balked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiegers suggests that we have business requirements, user requirements (the proper use cases) and functional requirements.  This certainly peels the outermost layers of the onion, and is a potential tool for guiding people into writing usable requirements.  But it has a small problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name &amp;quot;functional&amp;quot; requirements is a fairly serious problem with Wieger's breakdown.  Most people don't know what constitutes non-functional requirements.  Consequently, they just throw the phrase around more-or-less at random.  I have to object strongly when I'm shown a document with dozens of pages related to performance, maintainability, and ownership issues -- all non-functional requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core issue is that everyone wants to design the solution.  The more people you interview, the more you discover that everyone is an architect, and everyone has very strong opinions on precisely how to build the software solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At every level of the organization, you'll hear the following: &amp;quot;I'm not technical, but wouldn't it be simpler if...&amp;quot; followed by some kind of design.  If I remark on how their solution might have issues, they'll explain to me that one of their non-technical staff built something like their preferred solution in MS-Access during lunch-hours over the previous week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-why-cases"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Why Cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than ask &amp;quot;If your staff member is such a hot-shot programmer, why am I here?&amp;quot; it becomes important to dig into the real requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that we have the following kinds of requirements.  These aren't presented in a top-down order, but in an inside-out order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the user sees.&lt;/strong&gt;   These are the use cases.  The wisdom here is that we can use the definition (&amp;quot;A user interacts with a system to create business value&amp;quot;) to locate users, interactions, the system and value.  Absent these elements, we don't have a use case, and can set it aside as a solution design.  One of the acid-tests is to see if the use case addresses the &amp;quot;for whom?&amp;quot; question.  If this isn't someone's job, it isn't a use case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why the user's even doing this.&lt;/strong&gt;   These are the &lt;strong&gt;Why Cases&lt;/strong&gt;™ that bracket the Use Cases.  We can ask &amp;quot;why?&amp;quot; and locate the overall business requirements that create the use cases in the first place.  Generally, the use cases are a solution to a business problem; in some cases, they're a bad solution.  Asking &amp;quot;why?&amp;quot; periodically helps to focus people on the rational behind the use cases.  It helps us recognize that we're only building software to make someone happier and more productive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we'll support the user.&lt;/strong&gt;   This is a high-level design for the solution.  We can't call it functional requirements because few people know what the non-functional requirements are.  We can't call them &amp;quot;technical requirements&amp;quot; because this also leads to more confusion than it prevents.  We need to call it design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="passive-voice-reporting"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Passive Voice Reporting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best indicators of confusion seems to be the passive voice constructs like &amp;quot;the exception report will be generated daily.&amp;quot;  This invites us to ask two questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For whom?&lt;/strong&gt; This question will let us locate the proper use case.  Generating an exception report doesn't involve any interaction.  Someone looks at the exceptions, makes a decision, and takes action.  Who does this?  What are they supposed to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt;   This question will let us locate the driving business requirement.  For example, we may have a contractual obligation for a particular service level.  Someone must investigate each exception, determine a root cause, and take action to correct problems that are internal and finish processing the exceptional transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="customer-guidance"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Customer Guidance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we do when we're confronted with stuff that isn't really a requirement?  Generally, we're given design documents with titles like &amp;quot;Software Requirement Specification&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Use Case&amp;quot;.  Since the documents don't allow us any design choices, they aren't really requirements; they're specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All too often, folks have downloaded an SRS template (like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.processimpact.com/goodies.shtml"&gt;Wieger's&lt;/a&gt; ) and then abused the template.  I've seen SRS documents with the titles and template instructions still in place, essentially ignored by the author.  Large sections of the SRS template are left empty, because the author wasn't writing requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that we need to look at the design documents we're given ask the two fundamental questions: why? and for whom?  From these two questions we can back up to the business requirements and the use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, we can achieve a fundamental rethinking of the specifications to improve their value in a number of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-architect-gets-a-bentley"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Architect Gets a Bentley&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining who does the job gets us away from writing software that seems necessary to the author (&amp;quot;of course we need notification of exceptions&amp;quot;.)  It can help us locate software that really is essential (&amp;quot;typically, Frank checks the exceptions each once or twice a week by looking at the logs, not a report&amp;quot;).  If it isn't going to be done daily, why over-engineer the system?  If the logs satisfy the need, why design a report?  Why not target the implementation for what people will actually do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including the business requirements can simplify or focus the use cases.  If we can't articulate the business need, then we have the &lt;strong&gt;I Get A Bentley&lt;/strong&gt;™ requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a customer claim that they required 24x7 availability.  But they would not consider any hardware changes, and the hardware they had purchased couldn't provide the level of availability they were asking for.  When I brought this up, they claimed that 24x7 wasn't really a &amp;quot;requirement&amp;quot; it was more of a &amp;quot;goal.&amp;quot;  My follow-up question was &amp;quot;Where's the line?  What's the least availability that you'll tolerate before you sue me.&amp;quot;  They chuckled nervously, and said that any talk of lawsuits was irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn't irrelevant.  &amp;quot;Required&amp;quot; means required, as in &amp;quot;if the system doesn't do this, you don't get paid.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If 24x7 availability is a requirement, then &amp;quot;Architect gets a Bentley&amp;quot; is also a requirement.  There's no business justification for either position.  They were clearly a 12x5 operation, and could justify requiring 18x6 to cover weekends and west-coast timezones.  They could not show a business reason for 24x7 any more than I could show a business reason for a Bentley.  It may have been my goal, but I couldn't justify it as a contractual requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-bentley-test"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Bentley Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the answer to &amp;quot;why?&amp;quot; is isomorphic to &amp;quot;because I'm the customer,&amp;quot; then you've located a place to apply &lt;strong&gt;The Bentley Test&lt;/strong&gt;™.  If you get feature [&lt;strong&gt;X&lt;/strong&gt; ] because you're the customer, then I get a Bentley because I'm the architect.  It sounds fair to me.  Prove that it isn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phrases like &amp;quot;you must have known we wanted this when you wrote the proposal&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;if we didn't want that feature, why would we be building software?&amp;quot; are isomorphic to &amp;quot;because I'm the customer.&amp;quot;  Other examples include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Don't bother trying to save us money with Linux, we're an all-[&lt;strong&gt;Y&lt;/strong&gt;] shop.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;We absolutely have to have all of our purchased applications share a single common database -- without any of that schema mumbo-jumbo.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;You must fix our database without changing the user interface.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;You have to achieve acceptable performance with no hardware or data model changes.&amp;quot;  Followed by &amp;quot;no, we can't define acceptable.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, and I get a Bentley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the conversation is usually over.  There …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We wind up in this situation from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;I can't afford $$$, I can barely afford to Keep The Lights On™!&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the conversation is usually over.  There is more to talk about, much more.  However, most customers simply stop talking.  Even if try to respond along the line of the following, the conversation is usually over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Us&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;What do you need to know about the cost?  Software projects can grow without limit, so there's no practical upper bound.  Even with a tiny scope, you can polish and gold-plate that scope until it's too costly to consider.  Do you have some budget already in mind and want to know if I agree with it?  For any amount (even a silly amount like a week's revenue) something positive can be accomplished.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere there's this (false) expectation that given a vague statement of &amp;quot;requirements&amp;quot; there's a fixed, single dollar figure that will implement those requirements.  What's irritating is the &amp;quot;Keep The Lights On&amp;quot; rational for preventing progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does this come from?  Why is it so paralyzing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-situation"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Situation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it costs a fortune to KTLO, it usually means that a lot of labor is squandered on &amp;quot;break fix&amp;quot; work.  It's like paying a union electrician to replace the 10A fuse every time you use the 12A drill press.  If the motor was in a good position and there's not much load, the draw may be under 10A -- or over 10A for a short-enough period of time -- and everything's fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I get called in, it's because the drill press isn't doing everything people want it to do.  The changes will require rewiring the drill press.  The customer, however can't afford to rewire anything because the electrician is fully occupied changing fuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-remedy"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Remedy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if we have drill press and power problems, we'll need to fix the power distribution infrastructure first.  That will free up the electrician to rewire the drill press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sensible thing to do is to replace the fuse panel with higher-rated fuses.  This makes sense to me.  And it makes superficial sense to the customer and the electrician.  However, the customer has a kind of fundamental brain damage that makes this simple, sensible, incremental work impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-choke"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Choke&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The customer, for some reason, chokes on this.  Rather than just do it, we get into hand-wringing and justification.  In order to make it &amp;quot;palatable&amp;quot; to executives or peers or someone else, we have to fold in more features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple fuse upgrade turns into task to replace the fuses with circuit breakers.  There are fewer safety issues.  In someone's mind, an end-user can flip the breaker, and we don't need a skilled, union electrician to put fuses in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-choke-after-the-choke"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Choke After the Choke&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An IT manager has taken a simple task, choked, and made it more complex than is required.  Often, they choke a second time.  This second choke is the killer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than upgrade the fuse, we tried to replace the fuse box with a breaker panel.  But we then run out of time (or money or both) and stop the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have a half-rebuilt fuse box and a half-installed breaker panel.  We haven't freed up the union electrician.  We now need him on permanent overtime to sort out the wiring mess that was created by the second choke.  Each time a tool stops, we have to figure out if it is a fuse or a breaker, then make the necessary repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's this crazy double-choke that raises the cost of KTLO, and makes progress impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point the cost of KTLO prevents work from being done.  Everyone is tied up replacing fuses, tracking down wiring messes, and trying to troubleshoot production machinery which doesn't work correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, after enough frustration and turnover, this is &amp;quot;business as usual.&amp;quot;  Nothing can get done because we're so busy keeping the lights on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objects are characterized by their state change.  Therefore, to distinguish among classes of objects, we need to determine if two objects have the same states and state transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;States are defined by the object that undergoes the state change.  Therefore, we need to examine the object to distinguish among its states.  We need to know the object in order to know the states; we need to know the states in order to know the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we cut through this tangled hierarchy, and locate some place we can begin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moleskine.com/eng/default.htm"&gt;Mokeskines&lt;/a&gt;  and this Blog have many features in common.  They have very similar state transitions - writing, reviewing, editing, etc.  There are, however, some slight differences in state transition rules; based on those differences we can see that there may be a common superclass, but the individual subclasses are distinct.  In particular, my Moleskine has no &amp;quot;power off&amp;quot; state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we start from object identification and then determine state?  Or do we have to begin with state and use this to inform object identification?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="procedure"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Procedure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to begin with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2005_10_16-object_modeling_revised.html"&gt;noun analysis&lt;/a&gt; .  If, for some reason, you have only one noun, or cannot distinguish among the nouns, then you probably have very serious scope definition problems.  For example, if the only noun you can identify is &amp;quot;the system&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;the user&amp;quot; then your initial summary is deeply flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 4 suggests that you bounce back and forth among categorizing, associating, defining attributes and defining operations.  An addition activity is defining states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State definition can be tackled for a given noun using something like the following procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find examples&lt;/strong&gt;. To prevent fruitless hypothetical and counterfactual discussions it helps to have tangible examples of an object in each state.  For business documents, get print-outs.  For other kinds of objects, use notecards or sticky notes, or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.kooshball.com/"&gt;Koosh Balls&lt;/a&gt; ; use something tangible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characterize Each State&lt;/strong&gt;. For each example of a given state, highlight (or circle or underline or write down) the attributes which define the state.  States are defined by the attributes; they are not &amp;quot;implied&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;obvious&amp;quot;.  Expert judgement isn't part of this.  If things are implied, obvious or require judgement, you'll need to add attributes.  The best case is adding attributes to make the implied state into a manifest state.  A bad case is adding attributes that are going to be set by having an expert (i.e., a person) look at the other attributes and make their oracular pronouncement.  The worst case is where you cannot establish a finite, definite list of attributes that characterize the states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confirm&lt;/strong&gt;. At this point, you may have learned many things.  You may have, for example, found that your &amp;quot;object&amp;quot; was really a composite and you have multiple, parallel sets of states.  You may have found, for example, that your object has several associations, each of which has it's own set of states.  You may have found that some states are indistinguishable and other states have substates.  This is all good.  In some cases, you'll have to rework your object model, bounce around among categories, associations, attributes, operations, and begin this process again with a new object model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determine Transitions&lt;/strong&gt;.  We're not fully specifying things; we're only discovering.  It's important to set aside details for the moment, since many kinds of details only serve to muddy the waters.  In particular, processing details -- which are stateful -- can often confuse the identification of states.  To make it possible to see what's going on, the magic words &amp;quot;processing happens&amp;quot; have to be used when defining the transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examine each state, saying the words &amp;quot;processing happens&amp;quot; and determine what update will move the object to the next state.  The point is to avoid the details of the processing and focus on the net effect of the processing.  Some processing is an object's internal response to arriving in a state; other processing is initiated from outside the object to force it to a particular state.  &amp;quot;Processing Happens&amp;quot; and now the object is in a new state; capture this relationship first, provide details later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elaborate&lt;/strong&gt;. You've learned a great deal, and can add a few details at this point.  First, check for orphan states.  If you've got an object state (you have an example, right?) but you don't have any transitions to or from this state, you've got more work to do.  You may be missing some transitions, but you may also be missing some states; states which are intermediate between states you've identified and this orphan state.  An orphan state can also be caused by examining a composite object; this may be a state of one component of the composite object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have identified inital and final states, also.  Objects begin their existence in initial states.  Some kind of objects will reach a final state, from which no more state transitions are possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reconcile&lt;/strong&gt;.  You can now march an object through the various state transitions beginning from one of the initial states.  Generally, each &amp;quot;path&amp;quot; or sequence of transitions is a scenario for a potential life of this object.  It is essential that the tangible examples be compared against this model to be sure that all states are part of a scenario and all the scenarios make sense when compared with use cases or other source documentation.  If necessary, rework other elements of the model based on what has been learned so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elaborate&lt;/strong&gt;.  Now, at long last, you can write detailed specifications.  The reason details are left for last is because people often confuse state (&amp;quot;static&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;status&amp;quot;) with processing.  It's inevitable to think of the sequence of steps in an object's processing, not the stages along that lifeline.  At this time, you can finally write state entry and exit processing; this is processing which sets attributes, but doesn't change the overall state being modeled.  Each transition can be annotated with events, guard conditions and processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you should have a state transition or activity model that helps define your object class.  You can select a diagram, either state diagram or activity diagram, depending on what features need to be emphasized in the state model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use a state diagram when there is relatively little processing or the entity is relatively active.  When there is relatively little processing, a quick summary on a transition line, or within the state's rectangle conveys everything that's required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use an activity diagram when there is rather complex processing or the entity is passive, and is acted on by other objects.  An activity diagram adds activity states or responsibility swimlanes to the basic state machine notation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, both diagrams are required.  The state diagram shows the states and their transitions for a given object class.  An activity diagram may show the ways this object collaborates with other objects to achieve those state transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The comments are also handy for identifying the key dysfunctionality in an organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mindspring.com/~mgrand/"&gt;Mark Grand&lt;/a&gt;  shared with me a number of things that seem to make software development needlessly clumsy and complex.  Indeed, he theorized that there is a culture of complexity that worships clumsy process and management inefficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There happened to be seven kinds of dumb-ass complexities.  It isn't like the standard &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins"&gt;deadly sins&lt;/a&gt;  actually match up with complexities; the seven is just coincidental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="cause-and-effect"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cause and Effect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net effect of failing to come to grips with complexity are the dysfunctionalities that Scott Berkun (and many others) identified in his blog entry.  Let's look at a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADD (Asshole-Driven Development) for example, tackles everything head-on.  If you have a conflict between end-user requirements and technology budgeting, then an chief asshole can make a certain kind of motion happen:  it may not be progress, but it will be activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDD (Cognitive Dissonance Driven Development) is a way of encouraging a quantity of ideas in lieu of any high quality ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CYAE (Cover Your Ass Engineering) is what you do when you have a fragile, immature process.  Rather than actually solve the problem, you layer in more complexity -- particularly complex processes -- because that's rewarded more than success.  There's nothing like an integration test, performance test, QA test, user acceptance test, regression test dance to replace real understanding of the user's requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DBD (Development By Denial) is a way to cope with a failure to assess risks.  Software development is always about management of ignorance:  you must be ignorant of something, or you'd just download the solution.  Either you don't have the use cases fully understood, or the technology is new, or both; that's why you're building something.  Failure to manage ignorance means you are doing DBD development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In the real world we don't have time to explore every nuance,&amp;quot; for example, is classic DBD-speak.  Somehow ignorance must vanish, but we can't spend money on exploratory proof-of-concept prototypes or training in the new tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GMPM (Get Me Promoted Methodology) is what we do when we have a deep-seated fear of showing weakness.  We lead by fiat, making sure that our decisiveness gets us noted and promoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you don't know what you're doing, you pick a leadership style that maximizes activity in the hope that it might maximize progress.  You can be a jerk, foster disagreement, cover your ass, deny the obvious, and leverage the situation to make yourself look good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Mark was right, the complexity of software, and software development, makes people into bad leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think complexity and bad management are behind &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slott56.github.io/2007_02_18-its_drive_to_self_destruction.html"&gt;IT's Drive To Self-Destruction&lt;/a&gt; .  My person gripe centers on Next Year's Dollars (NYD) being less valuable than this year's dollars.  Dumb, bad design can be forced into production because maintenance (which goes on for decades) is cheaper that getting something done by the fantasy dead-line date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
