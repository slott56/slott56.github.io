It's hard to write shameless promotional material.

I already wrote the books, isn't that bold enough?

It isn't, though.


      Packt’s Head of Product, Oli Huggins, said: “We believe in helping
      to serve and support the global developer community. By selling
      our eBooks and Videos for $5, we hope to unlock exciting new
      opportunities for developers who, in other situations, wouldn’t
      have access to our products. A key part of our mission is to
      unlock new opportunities for developers, help them discover new
      technologies, and help put software to work in new ways."

Packt has curated some of our best titles together for the Python
Programmers community:

-  `Learn Python Programming - Second
   Edition <https://www.packtpub.com/free-ebook/learn-python-programming-second-edition/9781788996662>`__

I'm delighted to be part of the promotion. It's Christmas Eve. Even if
you don't celebrate this specific holiday, the passing of the winter
solstice is a time of renewal.
