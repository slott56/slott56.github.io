This was a fun conversation on Python and learning.

We didn't talk about my books in detail. Instead, we talked about
learning and what it takes to get closer to mastery.

It's a thing I worry about. I suspect other writers worry about it,
also. Will the reader take the next steps? Or will they simply think
they've got it because the read about it?
