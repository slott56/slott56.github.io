This is your "why wait" invitation.


Advanced copies will be available.


IF.


And this is a big "if".


You have to write a blurb.


I'll be putting you in contact with Packt marketing folks who will
get you your advanced copy so you can write blurbs and reviews and --
well -- actually use the content.


It's all updated to Python 3.8. Type hints almost everywhere.
F-strings and the walrus operator. Bunches of devops and data science
examples. Plus a few personal examples involving sailboat navigation
and management.


See me at LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-lott-029835/
and I'll hook you up with Packt marketing folks.


See https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Python-Cookbook-Updated-programmer/dp/180020745X
for the official Amazon Book Link. This is for ordinary "no
obligation to write a review" orders.


DM me directly slott56 at gmail to be put into the marketing
spreadsheet.
