At the time (2014), the 8Gb machine was way more than adequate for all
my needs as a writer.


Enter bloat.


Mac OS Catalina has essentially filled this machine to the breaking
point. Six short years is the lifespan. Things (generally) work, but
it now crashes frequently. Sometimes, streaming TV won't play
properly. I've tried a large number of remedies (reboot WiFi, reboot
computer, reset Bluetooth) and it glitches too offten to be
comfortable.


(Rumors suggest the crashes seem to be associated with going to
sleep. The machine crashes when it's idle. I come back to it and find
it has restarted, and needs to restart my apps. It's not horrible.
But it's an indication of a deeper problem. And it's time.)


It works. But. I've spent too many years waiting for slow computers
and slow networks. An hour a day (cumulative) for 300 days a year for
40 years means I've spent 1.3 years of my life waiting for a computer
to do something.


I’m reluctantly replacing my kind-of-working "Late 2013" vintage
machine with a new 13” MacBook Pro. At least 16Gb RAM. At least a
terabyte of storage. Hopefully, things will not be "glitchy" and I
won't have constant crashes.


I’ve gotten used to having an 27" Thunderbolt Display, and a USB
Querkywriter keyboard, and two USB disks doing backups. That's a lot
of stuff plugged in all the time. Also. I really **need** a slot for
SD cards (the boat uses micro SD cards, as does the old GoPro
camera.). So. A fancy USB-C hub will be essential, I think.


The question is 2 ports (power and hub) or 4 ports (power, hub, and
two other things)?  I suspect I can live with 2 ports.  4 ports ships
immediately.


I have several use cases:


-  Writing Python books (e.g. Modern Python Cookbook 2e, https://www.packtpub.com/product/modern-python-cookbook-second-edition/9781800207455)

-  Writing fiction. (Still editing second drafts, don’t hold your breath)

-  Creating a MicroPython (or Arduino) device to track my boat’s position and act as an alarm if the anchor drags

-  Boating (in a vague, general way)


Writing books actually requires some computing power. But. Not
\*too\* much power. The general reader doesn’t always have a huge
computer. If my examples require more computing power than my
readers have access to, that’s a problem. The advantage of having
a smallish computer is I’m not overstepping what’s available to my
readers. This is a handy way to take a tax deduction to pay for
this extravagance.


Writing fiction requires a small machine. Scrivener works on an iPad
Pro. I’m good with almost anything. Even an iPhone can be used for
writing and editing fiction. It’s hard, of course, with a tiny
screen. But not impossible. And. I'm trying to learn the craft, so
tools aren't as important as understanding character arc.


Creating MicroPython-based devices is a bit confusing right now. A
lot of the development environments depend on a reliable USB
connectivity to the Arduino or Circuit Playground Express board. I
worry about the (potential) complexity of introducing a USB hub into
the mix.  I suspect I only need to replace some of my USB cables; the
Arduino boards all seem to use a bulky USB type B. The CPX use USB
type Micro B. (I thinks one can be replaced with a USB C to USB B
“printer cable”, the other is a USB microB to C adapter. Or, maybe a
USB C to USB A adapter can be used with my vast collection of legacy
cables. Don't know.)


Boating involves connecting external devices like the GPS antenna to
the laptop and tracking position or planning routes. This is a
Bluetooth thing, generally.


It does require considerable power for the laptop; the 60W power
brick becomes a constraint. The boat have an inverter and can handle
the load gracefully. A computer is a dedicated 5A draw, though; twice
what the fridge pulls (and the fridge runs infrequently.) We have
225Ah available. The computer could be as bad as 120Ah if it was left
on for 24 hours during an overnight passage.


The good news is that the use cases are more-or-less exclusive. The
boating use case is rare. We have more thrifty navigation systems
permanently installed on the boat. Many folks are using CPX and
Arduino’s with MacBook Pro’s, so I shouldn’t worry too much, just buy
new cables.


The best part?


Since I use Time Machine, the new machine recovers from the Time
Machine backups. It has to be left to run overnight, but. Boom. Done.


(On the to-do list -- encrypt the backup volumes. Ugh. But.
Necessary.)
