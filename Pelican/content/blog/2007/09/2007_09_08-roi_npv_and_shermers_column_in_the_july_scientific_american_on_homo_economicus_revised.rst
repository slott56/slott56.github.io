Michael Shermer's column, in the July 2007 *Scientific American* , "`The
Prospects for Homo economicus <http://sciam.com/print_version.cfm?articleID=27333871-E7F2-99DF-3A66FD19F6C2AF91>`_ ", notes that we all impaired when it comes to
making economic decisions. 

 

Also, see Kathleen Melymuka's article in
the July 23, 2007 *Computerworld* , "`Boiling the IT Frog <http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&taxonomyName=project_management&articleId=297575&taxonomyId=73&intsrc=kc_feat>`_ ".   Harwell Thrasher
suggests that simple ROI calculations don't work.  The fact that we are all
impaired in making economic judgements puts this observation into sharp
perspective.

 

Also, see Jena McGregor's article in the June 15, 2007, *Business Week* , "`Clayton Christensen's Innovation Brain <http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/jun2007/id20070615_198176.htm>`_ ".   "...the mathematics have an implicit assumption within them that if we don't do this innovation, the way things are today will maintain themselves in the future."  In short, we assume we won't lose anything; which biases the analysis based on our biggest fear: loss.

 


Here's **The Big Issue** â„¢: We can't compare wins against losses. Our
brain is wired for "Prevent Loss Decision-Making". We magnify losses (and
potential losses) by a factor of 2.

 
 

Why?  Clearly, we want to keep what
we have.  Future gains are just wishful thinking, worth only half of what people
claim.  Future losses are a serious kick in the pants, the impact will be twice
as bad as the consultants predict

 
 

We can't inflate the future wins -- that's
insanity.  We can't easily diminish the potential for loss.  Or can
we?

 
 

The ROI Trap
------------

 
 

Thrasher (and others) note that simple ROI calculations aren't
always appropriate.  First, ROI is usually based on a pack of lies.  More
important, however, is that ROI doesn't include "possibilities" like
reusability, adaptability, flexibility, interoperability.  It's hard to compute
an expected value (probability times dollar value) for adaptation of software to
an as-yet-undefined new business model.

 
 

ROI of potentialities
is too rarefied for even an MBA in finance.  What's the discount rate on an
executive cutting a deal with a partner company that has a devastating impact on
the current data model?  We can't know.  So we shouldn't try.

 
 

CYA
---

 
 

Because decision-making is irrationally
loss-averse, it explains at lot of what passes for management.  It explains, for
example, why the possibility of risk is so central to IT decision-making.  If
there's risk, and if every manager on the food-chain has not identified the
down-sides of a project, they will be excoriated by their
superiors

the July 23, 2007 <i>Computerworld</i>, <a href=>`_ , notes that we all impaired when it comes to

Also, see Kathleen Melymuka's article in
the July 23, 2007 *Computerworld* , `This puts a lot of project rejection squarely in the prevent-loss
mode.  It also explains  `Keep The Lights On
Management <../C412398194/E20070628152000/index.html>`_ .  It supports KTLO decisions as replacing the risk of making a
mistake with the non-loss strategy of Keep The Lights On.  Any attempt to invest
outside the KTLO minimum exposes the enterprise to the possibility of loss,
which is unacceptable.

 
  

Making Progress
---------------

 
  

The deal seems to be
the following:  **Don't Mix Wins and Losses.** 

 
  

If a manager wants to know what the "impact" of
a software change is, don't give the full spectrum of
answers.

 
  

The possibility of a screw-up (or other kind of loss) is one
thing.

 
  

The potential win from getting the right software in place is
another thing -- treat it as if it had different units.

 
  

Further Notions
----------------

 
  

Also, we know that software isn't really "done."  If it's
home-brewed, and has any value at all, people will mess with it forever.  The
pace of change may fall from initial development team to maintenance team.  But
there's no "done" until the day to turn the software off because it was
replaced.

 
  

This means there's no price.  At least, there's no final, single,
big, ugly number.  Software acquisition is about the rate of expenditure over
future years.  $1M this year, $900K next year, $150K per year after that, *until the end of time* .

 
  

With an infinite stream of payments, what does ROI mean?  You have
to do ROI on a year-by-year, or release-by-release basis.  That's much more
rational than asking your vendors like me to make up an "overall"
price.  

 
  

How It Might Play Out
---------------------

 
  

If there's a 10% chance that you won't get
things converted by July of next year, then there's a possibility of loss.  You
could assign an expected value to this.  $1.5M spent, 10% of nothing to show for
it.  This is $150,000 loss.  But that puts you squarely into ROI-world, where
you don't want to be.

 
  

If there's a 90% chance of success and better
software, you could try and put a dollar value on this.  Except, of course, you
will probably deliver incrementally, and you'll have some return very early,
with accelerating returns after each release.  And the "potential" returns are
imponderable.  What to do?

 
  

The only thing you can do, is avoid talking
about loss and anything that looks like loss.  Don't lie, but don't dwell.  Yes,
there's a chance of failure, but it's small and it isn't random -- it's bad
management.  Yes, we'll be discarding some old software, but the new software
will allow [X], [Y] and [Z] which the old software didn't
allow.

 
  

Note the discarding of "some" old software.  In many cases, you will
discard *all*
old software.  However, because of our hard-wired economic bias, discarding old
software is a loss, and we cannot tolerate loss.  Generally, when you are
reworking old software, you will preserve the data, and many of the concepts. 
That's what's important, and that's what you can dwell on.

 
  

Say:  "We're not
reinventing the wheel." Even when you are going to delete the old
code.

 
  

Say:  "We're preserving all the old data." Even when you have to
completely restructure it from the non-relational to the relational
database.

 
  

Conclusion
-----------

 
  

It isn't IT managers (or managers in general)
who can't make rational technology decisions.  The natural human tendency is to
inflate losses and discount gains.  The only way to avoid the comparison problem
is to keep the losses (and possibilities of losses) widely separated from the
anticipated gains.

 
  

All of the project failures that I've ever seen
in 30 years of IT have been management problems.  Most are related to a
fundamental unwillingness recognize that early phases of analysis (and
architecture) are done in discovery mode.  Learning something new during
analysis should not be labeled as scope creep, and is not cause for cancelling
the project.  

 
  

Additionally, managers who want to grandfather in old
software because it looks "cheaper" or "simpler" are usually wrong.  They are
also unaware of their own human bias toward preventing loss.  They think their
being rational, even-handed and skillful.  Actually, they're just wrong about
the cost (and benefit) of moving forward.
