iBlog2 fixes a number of serious problems in iBlog1.  I'm happy so far.



Most of the glitches I've seen are appear to be documented in the Lifli `support forums <http://www.lifli.com/Support/index.html>`_ .  I do have a huge beef, however, which isn't a "bug," *per se*.  The Theme Builder is a bit rugged.  Rulers and paragraph spacing (the ``<b>`` vs. ``<p>`` issue) need to be resolved.



iBlog2 has too many features based on "right click," or as we Mac users know it, "control click".  All features based on right-click are nearly impossible to find.  I found the *Edit Link Settings*  mostly by luck, and only moments before giving up on iBlog entirely.



My going-in assumptions are the following.



1.  All features are on the basic menus.



2.  Some features have "accelerators" in the form of keystrokes or icons.



3.  Control-click (or right-click) is just an accelerator.



For many applications, these assumptions are met, and I can find things.  I'm happy and successful.



For some applications, however, these assumptions are violated and I stop trying to find things.  I don't hit "F1" or "Help" for things which appear to be missing in the first place.  I simply stop using the application.  It's a competitive marketplace, and if someone has either (a) bundled too much crap into their GUI or (b) can't be bothered to put it all into the main menus, I'll find someone can can do both (a) and (b).



"What's wrong with F1 or Help?"  Nothing.  They're fine.  I shouldn't have to search for the obvious, common use cases.  I shouldn't have to hit Help.  If I have to hit Help, it means one thing: my use cases do not match the application's use cases.  Period.



"But, why can't you learn to right click?"  There's a usability principle here: One Button should do it.  A touch-screen, for example, is effectively a One Button Interface -- tapping the screen is the one button.  A scratch pad on a laptop, for example, is generally a One Button Interface.  You can push the cursor around or you can tap it to make a click.



A shift-key or a second mouse button is an alternative -- it can't be the primary means of access.  The essential use cases for the application have to be the obvious left-mouse-button features from the menus.



Buttons are an impediment to use.  More buttons are simply a larger impediment.
