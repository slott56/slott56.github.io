First, I'm a pack-rat; I worry about deleting
something valuable.  Specifically, I worry about orphaned files because the
application software is no longer supported or the media is
obsolete.



For example, my resume is a
`Hypercard <http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=24522>`_  stack.  Really.  Hypercard is an OS 9
application, and future OS X's won't support it anymore.  However, I have an old
disk drive with an OS9 and Hypercard.  Consequently, I can't consider erasing
that disk drive.



For years, I've had a
TODO list item for designing a resume DTD, unwinding the Hypercard stack into
that DTD, and ditching Hypercard entirely.  I'd have to maintain my resume as a
massive XML database, but that's not all
bad.



This also means that I have old
computers laying around.  The current
`home network <http://www.itmaybeahack.com/homepage/steve/homenetwork.html>`_  update
shows an embarrassing surplus of home computers.  Here's one plan.

1.  Ditch the old `slot-loading iMac <http://lowendmac.com/imacs/blue.shtml>`_.
    It has a 10Gb drive, is G3 PPC, and S L O W.  It's land-fill
    material unless someone offers me $50 for it.

2.  Move the current `desk-lamp iMac <http://lowendmac.com/imacs/fpimac.html>`_
    out to pasture as the fall-back machine.  It's G4, so it isn't as
    slow.  And it's PPC, so it runs Hypercard until I get my act together to extract
    my resume from Hypercard.

3.  Start making more use of the MacBook that I
    had to buy as part of the $1,503.65
    `Coffee and MacBook <{filename}/blog/2006/11/2006_11_20-coffee_and_a_macbook.rst>`_
    experience.



However, I give up the big
keyboard and big display.   Tough choice.
