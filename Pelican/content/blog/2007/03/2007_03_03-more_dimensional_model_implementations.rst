I submitted a really
similar article to `DDJ <http://www.ddj.com/>`_  in September.  I heard nothing and I don't
like to nag, so I let it drop.  Although last time I nagged, the article was
sprung free from where it had been spiked and wound up on the web site.  I
figured this article wasn't up to snuff, so I rewrote it for PyCon.  I submitted
it to PyCon on 10/10, with a pretty complete
outline.



And then, wonderfully, someone
else does almost the same thing in Ruby.  I guess I was on the right
path.
