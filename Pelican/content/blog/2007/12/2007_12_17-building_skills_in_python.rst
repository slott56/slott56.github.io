Since I spend a lot of time on skill upgrades for my clients, my books are oriented around that theme.  It's something that I learned from `Jim Bullock <http://www.dorsethouse.com/authors/bullock.html>`_ : there's a :strong:`Clue Absorption Rate`, and you can't exceed that rate.  These books are about building skills incrementally.



I've got three Python-related titles.  [Links are on the right, under "Publications".]



1.  :strong:`Building Skills in Programming`.  This is for n00bs, and covers very basic topics.  This is an introduction to computers and programming; it leverages Python to help someone get their hands dirty making computers do stuff.



2.  :strong:`Building Skills in Python`.  If you've got a language or two under your belt, this will help you learn Python.  It covers every language feature, most of the built-in classes and some of the library.  It's 385 pages: it covers a lot of ground.  It's packed full of exercises and examples.  



3.  :strong:`Building Skills in OO Design`.  This has both Python and Java examples, and moves from language skills to more serious design skills.  This is somewhat more ambitious because it directs the reader through construction of a fairly sophisticated application program, and covers debugging, testing and rework issues.

However, if you want to create courseware, contact me, I have a lot of material, we can work something out.



If you want to comment or correct this, please do; I'm open to suggestions.



:strong:`Plans`



I've got to upgrade both Python books to Python 2.5.  



Start on database design, since that's a skill that I coach fairly often.



Resolve the FOP embedded font problem.
