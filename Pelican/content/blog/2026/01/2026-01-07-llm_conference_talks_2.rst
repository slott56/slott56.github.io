Please do **not** use an LLM to create a conference talk.

Please.

If you can't be bothered to put in the effort to write your own material,
why should we put in effort to read the LLM slop you had your LLM post to the submission form?

What's in it for us, if you won't do the work?

See `LLM Conference Talks <{filename}/blog/2026/01/2026-01-01-llm_conference_talks.rst>`_ for more information.

Some Observations
=================

**LLM's Can't Be Accountable**

Making an LLM more "accountable" is nonsense. Only people can be held accountable for the decisions they make. If the LLM isn't a tool, actually used by an actual person, the proposed software architecture is nonsensical.

When an LLM makes a criminally bad decision, who will be held responsible?
The answer can't be "no one" or "that's really hard."

If there's no person in the loop, it's just a bad idea. Stop now and don't submit it as a conference talk.

**LLM's Don't Outline**

When the submission form asks for an outline, please try to make sure the outline your LLM generated actually looks like an outline.  When the LLM spews a big wall of text, we tend to view your thoughtless submission as thoughtless. (And actually insulting because it pushes the work onto the program committee.)

LLM's can (and do) over-compensate for your lack of detail and include "objectives", "activities", "topics", "outcomes" or other junk for each and every bullet-point. Outside primary and secondary education curriculum development, all this detail isn't impressive. It's depressing.

**LLM Meta-Speak**

When your LLM generates "meta-speak", you've lost those of us trying to figure out what you're going to present.

For example, when your "outline" has items like this:

- Start with humorous anecdote

- Include illustration to show the context of the problem

- Talk about reasons why this problem is very serious

The LLM has spewed some kind of generic template text; it's telling you what you **should** be doing.

It tells us nothing about what you actually **will** do.

Please fix your submission. Or get a better LLM. Or do some prompt-fu.

**LLM Keyword Splat**

Check your LLM's output carefully. When it's got lots and lots and lots of details -- essentially a splot of keywords and buzz-phrases -- then you're not really telling us what you're going to present. It's rehashing all the keywords it could find.

The outline the LLM generates for your presentation should state the actions you will actually take when you actually talk to actual people. It shouldn't be a wall of keywords.

Summary
=======

Maybe don't use an LLM to write your submission. It usually looks like slop.
