We worked through this about a year ago, **without** the help of this
post. Having the article would have saved us some time and effort. You
should bookmark it.

We liked this tech stack because it was simple and effective.
The team I'm on now is using NGINX and uWSGI as well as Python3 and
Flask. It's also effective and it's also pretty simple. It has a few
more moving parts, but works reliably.
