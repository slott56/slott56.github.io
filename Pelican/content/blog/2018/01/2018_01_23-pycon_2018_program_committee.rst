I was "volunteered" by a colleague to help the program committee for
`PyCon 2018 <https://us.pycon.org/2018/about/>`__. I rarely think of
myself as qualified for this kind of thing. Yes. I have six books on
Python (with a seventh on the way) but the PSF folks are brilliant and
dedicated and hard-working, and I'm just a slob.


Yes, I do get to help the community by reviewing almost 700
individual proposals. Some good. Some really good. Some which we
*must* hear.


The collateral benefit?


Side reading.


My browser history is filled with things I hadn't known existed.


Next time, I need to get started \*before\* the deadline so I can
have a little more interaction with the authors. There were a few
outlines where we could only discuss the possibility of making a
change if the proposal was accepted.


In particular, there seemed to be a *lot* of Machine
Learning-Bayesian-Deep Learning-Recommender-Data Science pitches that
had abbreviated outlines. They tend to all look alike to someone
who's not an expert. Five bullet points: the author's background, the
problem domain, ML (or modeling or whatever), a Jupyter notebook
showing the results, and a conclusion.  Providing some distinct angle
to the pitch (other than the problem domain) might help **me**
understand them more fully. It seemed best to defer to the consensus
on these.

I've been learning to live with my personal bias against meta-talks
about building community. A presentation on community building at a
community event seems redundant to me. But that doesn't mean they're
not thorough, articulate talks that will be useful to others. Since I
have a seat at the table, I'm biased. The Python tie-in feels weak,
but our code of conduct (Open, Considerate, Respectful) means PyCon
really **is** the place for more of this. Most importantly, they're
objectively solid talks. (And -- as a member of the the
over-represented old male nerd class, I do need to listen more.)
It's been enlightening. And the conference will rock.
