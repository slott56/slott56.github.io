| After many words, the email chain I received netted out to this:

#. I can't teach myself data science on my crappy old Windows machine.
#. I've decided to get a new Windows machine. Here are the specs.

| My response was a mixture of incredulity and bafflement.
| It appears that two things happened while I wasn't paying attention.

#. Apple ceased to exist.
#. The cloud ceased to exist.

| I'm aware that many people think the Apple alternative is a
  non-starter. They are sure that after 40+ years selling computes,
  Apple is doomed, and we'll only have Windows on the desktop.
  Seriously.
| Some people have farcical explanations for why Apple **Cannot be Taken
  Seriously**.
| In this specific instance, there was a large investment in Python and
  Java that somehow couldn't be rebuild in Mac OS X. Details were
  explicitly not provided. Which is a way of saying there were no
  tangible "requirements" for this upgrade. Just specification numbers.
| Import note. None of this involved "data" or "science." That was the
  baffling part. No objective measurement of anything. No list of
  software titles. No projects. No dataset sizes. Nothing.
| The anti-cloud argument was even stranger than the anti-Mac argument.
| Somehow, a super-large AWS server -- let's say it was a x1.16xlarge --
  being used an hour a day (365 day*1 hr/day*$1.82/hr = $664) was deemed
  \*more\* expensive that a 64Gb 6-core home-based machine that would
  sit idle 23 hours each day.
| The best part of $664/yr being \*more\* expensive?
| Expert Judgement.
| No "data". No "science". No measurement. No supporting details.
| I wish I'd kept the email describing how someone who knew something
  said something about pricing.  It was marvelous **Highest Paid
  Person's Opinion** nonsense.
| AFAIK, they were using 8,766 hours per year to compare AWS computing
  vs. at-home computing. This meant that an m5.4xlarge should be
  considered as costing $1,939 each year. Presumably because they'd
  never shut it off.
| It included terms like "half-way decent performance."
| There's a depth of wrongness to this that's hard to characterize
  beyond no "data" and no "science".
