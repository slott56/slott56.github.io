| The #Python Interviews book is out. Mike Driscoll interviewed a bunch
  of Python experts. And me, too. get 30% off the Amazon paperback
  version of the book using the code 30PYTHON: \ https://goo.gl/5A3uhq

  Here's a flavor of how this went:
| 

   **Driscoll**: So how did you end up becoming an author of Python
   books?
   **Lott**: Most roles in my career more or less just happened to me,
   but becoming a writer was a conscious decision.
   In this case, I had decided that there could be value in teaching the
   Python language and the associated software engineering skills. I
   started to collect notes for a book in 2002. By 2010, I had tried
   self-publishing several books on Python.
   When Stack Overflow started, I was an early participant. There were
   many interesting Python questions. The questions showed gaps where
   more information was needed about Python specifically and software
   engineering in general. Over a few years, I answered thousands of
   questions about Python and somehow built up a large reputation.
