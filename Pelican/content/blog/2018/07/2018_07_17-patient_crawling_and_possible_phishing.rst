Once every few months I get an email like this. What is it? Phishing?

I've finally looked into it, and learned two important lessons.

Here's the body of the email.

   
      Hello there,
      Your page
      http://www.itmaybeahack.com/homepage/iblog/C364310209/E20080407095503.html
      has some good references to cyber security so I wanted to get in
      touch with you. I've recently written an article **The 6 Types Of
      Cyber Attacks To Protect Against In 2018** and was wondering if
      you thought my article could be a good addition to your page.
      You can read my article right here:
      https://pagely.com/blog/cyber-attacks-in-2018/
      I would like to hear your opinion on this article. Also, if you
      find it useful, please consider linking to it from your page I
      mentioned earlier. If you prefer you may republish the article.
      Let me know what you think.
      Thank you very much,


Really?

The page they cited has three (3) external links. One is to actual
cyber security content. Another now gets redirected to generic
advertising, and the third (like the original blog post) is a decade
old.

What does this mean?

Clearly, it means some bot found my page. One of the links was to
something they're trying to SEO boost. (How do I know it's SEO? I
don't. The email address is similar to an SEO boosting company, so it
seems like that's what's going on here.)

I've been haphazard about responding to these because I'm a
fundamentally charitable person.

Or I'm a total pushover to certain kinds of social engineering. You
choose.

You see the appeal to my vanity in the email? They read my ancient
content! Swoon!

The email looks personal. There's a name. Spelled consistently. With
no digits in it. Someone read my content and reached out to me! I'm in
love! Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life at last, I've found you!

The email makes me think -- somehow -- it's not a bot and there's a
person involved. A person trying to make a buck selling content and
advertising. I should help them, right? Amplify their signal and all?

What a chump I am! I **should** simply ignore these.

In the past, I have responded with a "Nope. That content is too old to
do anything with. I should delete it but I'm too lazy." Once a bot
found a link on live content, and I dutifully updated it. I now know
any response is a mistake.

I checked out the page.ly site. It's a nice summary of cyber attacks.
It seems to be a not-to-dangerous link to not-bad content. Except for
the Unicode errors throughout the document. Like someone copied and
pasted the original bytes -- intended for CP-1252 -- to a site
explicitly using UTF-8.

That's not all.

The name on the email, and the author of the article don't match.  The
email says "my article" but the article has a different author.

Red Flag.

After (finally) spending five minutes on this, I learned two things.

-  First: this is nonsense. It's some kind of phishing attack. Or some
   kind of SEO-boosting bot that doesn't check dates very well.

-  Second: I'm an easy mark when people appeal to my vanity. I need to
   stop responding, no matter how effusive the (inferred) praise I think
   I'm hearing.
