`Freezing Pythonâ€™s Dependency Hell in

Excellent advice.
Excepot for the "Don't use Anaconda." Yes. It's a big download. Odds are
good you'll need most of it. So. Just do it now.
The (miniconda + environment.yml) as an entry point is really good. The
"rely on people to actually know and consistently use their best
practices" doesn't seem like a problem, it seems like a consequence of
an evolving software ecosystem.
