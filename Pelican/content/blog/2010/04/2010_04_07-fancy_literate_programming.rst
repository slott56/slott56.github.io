My bias is toward "printable" documents. I like the idea of an HTML
document that is directly printable. I've used tools like `Flying
Saucer <https://xhtmlrenderer.dev.java.net/>`__ (and appropriate CSS) to
guarantee printability.

I like using `ReStructured Text <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`__ to create HTML
and LaTeX that match precisely.

When I think of Literate Programming, I'm biased toward print.

However, HTML has a lot of power. Taking off the blinkers for a
moment, one can see that rich HTML and Javascript may be a really
workable approach.

Take a look at the `Literate Molly Module <http://literate-molly.sourceforge.net/>`__: another
tool for Literate Programming. This is an example of using rich
HTML as a vehicle for literate programming.
