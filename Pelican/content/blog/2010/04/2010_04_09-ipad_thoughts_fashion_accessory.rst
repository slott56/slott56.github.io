From a Blog that's inside a company's firewall, so this had to be
heavily edited.

  "The instant ON is a relief. The full page touch screen works just
  like on the iPhone - only better. Web pages look great..
  Photographs and Movies are fabulous. The screen resolution is
  fantastic. Sharing pictures makes it clear that the photo album is
  history. Tough times for Kindle. Email - much better than on the
  Blackberry. The things we like on the PDAs are all more attractive
  - and more usable! Almost like on a laptop."

Also.

  "I did not have an easy way to view Excel & Powerpoint. 3G is not
  available for another month. ... No Adobe Flash. For some, the one
  big 'flaw' will be the lack of a 'file system'."

Finally, emphasis mine.

  "The iPad is not a big leap, it is just a step, a big iTouch. But
  this is the last step that brings a whole new vision home. While
  not quite ready for Enterprise deployment, it gives us time to get
  going. *And this may be the Tablet that makes it acceptable for
  men to carry handbags*"

Okay. Time to start shopping for a nice

messenger bag.

What a very American perspective! Perhaps it might already be acceptable
in other countries?
