Here's a great post called "`Toward a Catalog of Scrum
Smells <http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/system/article/file/11/ScrumSmells.pdf?1267552461>`__".
This lists some "Management Smells": specifically doing clumsy,
ineffective things and calling it "Scrum".

I found this in StackOverflow question, titled "`Any stories where
trying to apply Scrum went
wrong? <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3293691/any-stories-where-trying-to-apply-scrum-went-wrong>`__"

Another great answer was a link to "`Scrummerfall: World's Worst
Software Development
Methodology <http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1392832>`__."

What's interesting to me is that (1) Scrum works -- or you'd have
more horror stories -- and (2) people do it wrong all the time.

Most of the Scrum-Done-Badly smells amount to management-as-usual.
Rather than empower the developers, managers insist on long, stupid
status meetings the purpose of which is to inform management. Rather
than trust the developers to get things done, managers insist on
detailed plans of little value to the developers.
