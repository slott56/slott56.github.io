I've updated `Building Skills in
Programming <http://homepage.mac.com/s_lott/books/nonprogrammer.html#book-nonprogrammer>`__
-- an introduction to programming for non-programmers.

The entire thing was redone in
`RST <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`__ and
`Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`__, leading to an easier-to-read,
more colorful layout. The cross-references are generally better and
more complete. I also get Sphinx's indexing and search capabilities.

Everything was touched, chapters were added and rearranged. Numerous
Python 3 reminders were added.

I can now -- easily -- include Google Adsense advertising on each
chapter.

Next steps will be to upgrade my MacOS Python to 2.6.2 and then
revise the book to cover 2.6 so that it is completely up-to-date.
Also, the math needs to be redone using one of the Sphinx Math
extensions so that the resulting LaTeX (and PDF) work out correctly.

Currently, my casual use of dozens of Unicode math characters has
lead Sphinx to create LaTeX that isn't source encoded properly.
