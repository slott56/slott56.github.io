Python Book -- Version 2.6

Completely revised the `Building Skills in
Python <http://homepage.mac.com/s_lott/books/python.html>`__ book.

It now covers Python 2.6 and is much, must easier to maintain in
`ReStructured Text <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`__
markup, formatted with `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`__ and
`LaTeX <http://www.latex-project.org/>`__ (via
`TeXLive <http://www.tug.org/texlive/>`__) than it was in XML.

XML -- while modern and clean and uniform -- isn't as convenient as
LaTeX and RST.

Ahhh.... I can't download it at work because a stupid "personal home
page" error on our corporate firewall... I will take a look at it at
home.
I'm interested on the RST code, is it visible from any link?


Great book.
