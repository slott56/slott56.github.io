I've (finally) updated the pyWeb Literate Programming Tool.

There were feature requests and bug reports. Much to do. Sadly, I'm
really slow at doing it.

Excellent tool!! Thanks a lot!
But can you help me with one little problem? I want to use it with
C/C++, a special with C-macros which is ended with '\\' (backslash). So,
if I use '\\' - I get in doc chunk in ONE line, in .H file all is good.
If I use '\\\\' (2 backslashes), doc looks good but I get in .H file two
ending ('\\\\').
How to use the tool for C-macros?
