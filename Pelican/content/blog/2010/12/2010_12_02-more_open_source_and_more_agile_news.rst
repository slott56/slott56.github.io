ComputerWorld, November 22, 2010, has this: "`Open Source Grows
Up <http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9197420/Open_source_grows_up>`__".
The news of the weird is "It's clear that open-source software has moved
beyond the zealotry phase." I wasn't aware this phase existed. I hope to
see the project plan with "zealotry" in it.

The *real* news is "More than two-thirds (69%) of the respondents
said they expect to increase their investments in open source."
That's cool.

Be sure to read the sidebar "Many Enterprises Aren't Giving Back."
There's still a lot of concern over intellectual property. I've seen
a lot of corporate software -- it's not that good. Most companies
that are wringing their hands over losing control of their trade
secrets should really be wringing their hands because their in-house
software won't measure up to open-source standards.

I like this other quote: 'Five years ago, the South Carolina
government was "considering writing a policy to prohibit or at least
'control' open source".' I like the "Must Control Open Source"
feeling that IT leadership has. Without this mysterious "control",
the organization could be swamped by software it didn't write. How's
that different from being swamped by software products that involve
contracts and fees? And requires `Patch
Tuesday <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Tuesday>`__?

**Agility**

SD Times has two articles on Agile methods. Both on the front page of
a print publication. That's how you know the technique has "arrived".

First, there's "`VersionOne survey finds agile knowledge and use on
the
rise <http://www.sdtimes.com/VERSIONONE_SURVEY_FINDS_AGILE_KNOWLEDGE_AND_USE_ON_THE_RISE/By_Katie_Serignese/About_AGILE_and_VERSIONONE/34936>`__".
My favorite quote: "Interestingly, management support, the ability to
change organizational culture and general resistance to change,
remained at the forefronts of participants’ minds when indicating
barriers to further agile adoption." I like the management barriers.
I like it when management tries to exert more 'control' over a
process (like software creation) that's so poorly understood.

Here's the companion piece, "`For agile success, leaders must let
teams loose <http://www.sdtimes.com/link/34886>`__". This is all good
advice. Particularly, this: '"It’s hard to not command and control,
but leadership is not about managing work. It’s about creating a
capable organization that can manage work," [Rick Simmons] added.'

If you're micro-managing, you're not building an organization.
Excellent advice. However, tell that to the financial control crowd.

**Budgets and "Control"**

Finally, be sure to read this by Frank Hayes in ComputerWorld: "`Big
Projects, Done
Small <http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/352786/Big_Projects_Done_Small>`__".
Here are the relevant quotes: "The logical conclusion: We should
break up all IT projects into sub-million-dollar pieces." "The
political reality: Everybody wants multimillion-dollar behemoths."
"...huge projects get big political support."

In short, Agile is the right thing to do until you're trying to get
approval. Bottom line: use Agile methods. But for purposes of
pandering to executives who want to see large numbers with lots of
zeroes, it's often necessary to write giant project "plans" that you
don't actually use.

Go ahead, write waterfall plans. Don't feel guilty or conflicted.
Some folks won't catch up with Agility because they think "Control"
is better. Pander to them. It's okay.

If you really want to get "them" annoyed, say something like "control is
at best a passing illusion."
