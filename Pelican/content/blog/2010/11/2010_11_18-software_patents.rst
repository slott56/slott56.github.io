Here's an interesting news item: "`Red Hatâ€™s Secret Patent Deal and the
Fate of JBoss
Developers <http://www.nytimes.com/external/gigaom/2010/11/12/12gigaom-red-hats-secret-patent-deal-and-the-fate-of-jboss-98607.html?ref=technology>`__".

Here's an ancient -- but still relevant -- piece from Tim O'Reilly:
"`Software and Business Method
Patents <http://tim.oreilly.com/patents/index.csp>`__".

Here's a great article in Slate on the consequences of software
patents. "`Weapons of Business Destruction: How a tiny little
'patent troll' got BlackBerry in a
headlock <http://www.slate.com/id/2135559/>`__".

The biggest issue with software patents is always the "non-obvious"
issue. Generally, this can be debated, so a prior art review is far
more valuable.

See "`Peer Review Starts for Software Patent Applications: IEEE
Spectrum talks to the founder to Peer-to-Patent Beth
Noveck <http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/peer-review-starts-for-software-patent-applications/0>`__".
This is where the rubber hits the road.

To participate, see `Peer To
Patent <http://www.peertopatent.org/>`__. Locate prior art and make
patent trolls get real jobs.

Also, see this: "`A patent improvement: Intellectual property: A new
scheme will solicit comments via the internet to improve the vetting
of patent
applications <http://www.economist.com/node/9719020?story_id=9719020>`__".

Just like we don't want patents to restrict software development, we
don't want companies to restrict the flow of info on the internet. Check
out the article by Tim Berners-Lee in Scientific American titled "Long
Live the Web"
