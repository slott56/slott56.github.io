Love this from Gartner. "`Gartner Estimates Global 'IT Debt' to Be $500
Billion This Year, with Potential to Grow to $1 Trillion by
2015 <http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1439513>`__".

NetworkWorld ran a quicky version of the story. Gartner: `Global 'IT
debt' hits $500 billion, on the way to $1
trillion <http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/092310-global-it-debt.html>`__.

ComputerWorld -- to be proper journalists -- have to get a balancing
quote. Their version of the story is this: `Gartner warns of app
maintenance
'debt' <http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/352022/Gartner_Warns_of_App_Maintenance_Debt_?intsrc=print_latest>`__.
The balancing quote is the following:

    "There are many good reasons to NOT upgrade/modernize many
    applications, and I believe Gartner is out of line using words
    like 'debt' which have guilt associated with them,"

"Guilt"? That's a problem? Why are we pandering to an organization's
(i.e., CIO's) emotional response?

I'm not sure that using a word like "debt" is a problem. Indeed, I
think they should ramp up the threat level on this and add words like
"short-sighted" and "daft" and perhaps even "idiotic".

Anyone who doesn't believe (or doesn't understand) technical debt
needs only to review the Y2K plans and budgets. A bad technology
decision lead to a mountain of rework. Yes, it was all successful,
but it made IT budgeting difficult for years afterwords.

The rest of the organization was grumpy about having their projects
were stalled until after Y2K. IT created it's own problems by letting
the technology debt accumulate to a level where it was "fix or face
an unacceptable risk of not being able to stay in business."

How many other latent Y2K-like problems are companies ignoring?
