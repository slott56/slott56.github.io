Let's say you've found some new, good way to do business.

JSON, for example. Or Agile Methods in general. Or TDD specifically.
Or use of an ORM.

You read up on it. You build a spike solution to show that it's more
efficient.

The First No-Gate
-----------------

You make The Essential Pitch. You keep it simple and direct.

A manager says "that's too *Blah-Blah-Blah*, we don't want to add the
cost/risk/complexity." Of course, it doesn't matter what specific
things are said. This is management "No #1". We just can't. There is
too much "we" (that is, "I, as a non-technical manager") don't
understand.

The first answer must generally be "No." No manager can agree unless
it was their idea before it was your idea. If they'd already heard of
this and ask you to look into it, then you might get a yes. But if it
was your idea first, management must say "No".

You work some more, you refine your pitch to address the
*Blah-Blah-Blah* issue and show that it does not actually increase
cost, risk or complexity.

BTW, there's no point in trying to pre-empt the initial "No". It has
to be there. You have to get specific objections, so you have to go
through this "No" gate.

The Second No-Gate
------------------

You make the Address-Your-Concerns Pitch. You elaborate with lots of
what-ifs and alternatives and objections and solutions. Two
Powerpoint slides expand to about a dozen.

A manager says "I'm not sure that it has the cost-benefit we need to
see." This is management "No #2". We just can't afford it. [*Yes,
this is a repeat of the cost argument, but it's different because the
expected response is now different*.]

The second answer must always "raise the bar" from technical issues
to monetary issues.

At this point, you really can't go too far. There's essentially no
cost-benefit information on any element of any technology stack in
use anywhere. No one sits down and finds the most cost-effective
operating system, the most cost-effective language, the most
cost-effective protocols. There's no data and cost-benefit is not a
core part of approval. It's tangential at best.

Further, the real answer in technology selection always boils down to
skills. Does the organization have the necessary skills? Do they
understand it?

You work some more, you refine your pitch to address the
cost-benefit issue and show that it does not actually increase
cost, may reduce risk, and have have some tangible benefits.

The Third No-Gate
-----------------

You make the Cost-Benefit pitch. You try to keep it factual.

At this point, you've entered a loop. Essentially, you must be
redirected to address one more concern. That concern, once
addressed, won't have the monetization. Back and forth until
something breaks you out of the loop.

You're stuck here because there's no *compelling* reason to adopt.
Managers talk about cost and risk and benefits and other vaguely
monetary ways to determine if the technology has or creates value.
But those are reasons to say "no", not "yes." Technology rarely
has a compelling monetized business case. It's just a little
better or a little less risky. But that involves change and any
change is inherently more risky than anything else.

Remember: the first fax machine was useless until someone else got
a fax machine.

So you iterate. Pitch, refine. Pitch, refine.

Compulsion
----------

At some point, you either implement your spike solution, which
makes management's approval a *fait accompli*, or some force
outside IT (business demand for a new kind of software product,
external force from competitors) compels the organization to make
a change.

Note that there has been no change to the technology itself. JSON
was unacceptable until a customer demanded JSON-format files. Now
JSON is required. The organization, however, has flipped from "No
with a million reasons" to "Yes".

Agile cannot be done until a customer requires it. TDD has no ROI
until someone gets their project done early because of TDD. An ORM
is needless complexity until the new web framework requires it.

At this point, there are a series of steps to go from "acceptable"
to "required" to "standard" to "irreplaceable legacy". Those just
as puzzling as the No-Gates.

Finesse
-------

It isn't possible to finesse this and reduce the frustration. The
organization *must* resist change until compelled to make the
change. Once compelled, it must then stumble forward as though all
the nay-saying never happened. And what could have been a simple
technology adoption must turn into a morass of competing bad
ideas.

So, we can (and should) continue to find new technology. We can
(and will) make the pitch. We will be shot down.

The trick is not to take it personally. Just keep refining so that
when the organization is eventually compelled to adopt, we've
already got it planned out.

Check out "Stop Trying to Reinvent the Wheel by Scott Berkun"
(http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/jun2010/id2010062_565850.htm).
The key paragraph: The second reason for reinvention pertains to ego and
rewards. In many corporations there is more prestige to be gained for
making something new than for reusing work done elsewhere in the company
or industry. This is true even when the newly made thing is much worse
that what already existed. An executive might proclaim the wonders of
the new (worse) thing to his division without encountering anyone
willing to stand up for the old (better) thing. It's harder to inflate
the importance of one's own work if the key decision was to buy or
borrow from elsewhere. The verbs "make," "invent," and "create" lead to
more promotions than "reuse," "borrow," or "convert." In Pavlovian
terms, if a culture rewards unnecessary reinvention more than it honors
wise reuse, the ambitious will follow suit. Asking people to behave one
way while rewarding them for another has predictable results. The
counter notion to NIH—"PFE," or "Proudly Found Elsewhere"—has been
talked about before, but I've rarely seen it thrive.

... hundreds of people involved who, given their incentives, are
virtually programmed to say "no." ... everyone can say "no," and worse,
since their incentives are loaded toward risk avoidance (they get
punished for violating procedure, but never punished for missing an
opportunity), they have a tendency to say "no" a lot, in fact to say
"no" by default. In the Gulf we have a thousand federal employees from
20 agencies whose entire incentive system--whose entire career--whose
every lesson from every bureaucratic battle in a sort of long-term
aversion therapy, prompts them to say "no" by reflex ...
