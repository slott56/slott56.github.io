They say "`You Can't Manage What You Don't
Measure <http://management.about.com/od/metrics/a/Measure2Manage.htm>`__".
This isn't quite right, however. You can measure lots of things you
can't manage. Rainfall, for example. Software development is like that.
You can measure stuff that you can't actually control.

The original
`Deming <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming>`__ quotes
are more subtle: there are things which you cannot measure, but they
are still important. And there are visible measures that are an
attractive nuisance.

What gets lost is that "any observed statistical regularity will
tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control
purposes" This is `Goodhart's
Law <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law>`__.

As soon as you try to measure "programmer productivity" or
"quality" or similar things, folks will find ways to tweak the
numbers without actually improving anything.

Metrics are troubling things.

"You can't manage what you don't measure" doesn't imply "you can manage
what you do measure", or am I missing something?
