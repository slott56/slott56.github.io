Making the rounds: `Droopy: easy file
receiving <http://stackp.online.fr/?p=28>`__. Apparently, there were
some widely-read blog posts about this. Google "Droopy: A Tiny Web
Server That Makes Receiving Files a Snap" to see the buzz.

The point here is that 750 lines of Python code can go a long way.
It's a complete web server to support large file transfers without
the botheration of email servers and their limitations.

Elegantly, it's packaged as a single module including HTML page
templates, translations into several languages, plus the core server.
