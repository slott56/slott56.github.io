    :alt: Adobe Error Dialog Box

Consider this dialog box.

-   The application was modified.

-   It can't be updated.

Why not just replace it? Replacing a modified application seems to be
a perfectly sensible use case.

But no, rather than doing something useful, it shows a dialog box. I
guess no one thought through this use case and asked what -- if
anything -- the Actor actually cares about. Doing installs is not one
of my goals as an actor. Managing installations is not one of my
goals. I want to (a) read PDF's and (b) have everything else handled
automatically.
