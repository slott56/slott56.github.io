I read a 482-word treatise that amounted to these four words "sales and
delivery disagree".

A more useful summary is "Sales and Delivery have different views of
the order".

It started out calling the standard sales-delivery differences a
"Conflict" requiring "Resolution". The description was so
hopelessly enmeshed in the conflict that it code-named sales and
delivery as "Flintstones" and "Rubbles" as if they might see their
names in the email and object. [Or -- what's more likely the case
-- the author refused to see the forest for the drama among the
trees.]

What?

Sales and delivery are in perpetual conflict and there is no
"resolution" possible. I assume this "resolution" comes from living
in a fantasy world where order-to-fulfillment and
fulfillment-to-invoice processes somehow are able to agree at each
step and the invoice always matches the order in every particular.

If this were *actually* true, either sales or delivery would be
redundant and could be eliminated from the organization.

Fantastic Software
------------------

I'm guessing that someone fantasized about an order-to-invoice
process and wrote software that didn't reflect any of the actual
issues that occur when trying to deliver services. Now, of course,
reality doesn't match the fantasy software and someone wants a
"solution".

Part of finding that solution appears to be an effort to document
(482 words!) this "drama" and "conflict" between sales and delivery.

Here's what I observed.

#.  Take a standard process of perfectly typical complexity and
    fantasize about it, writing completely useless software.

#.  Document the process as though it's a titanic struggle between two
    evil empires of vast and malicious sociopaths with innocent little
    IT stuck in the middle as these worlds collide. Assign code-name
    to sales and delivery to make the conflict seem larger and more
    important than it is.

#.  Start layering in yet more complexity regarding "conflict
    resolution algorithm" and other buzzwords that aren't part of the
    problem.

#.  Start researching these peripheral issues.

That makes a standard business process into something so complex that
one could spend years doing nothing useful. A make-work project of
epic proportions.
