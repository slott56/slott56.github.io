See Paul Glen's opinion piece on `Projects and the Ungrounded
Middle <http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/346443/Projects_and_the_Ungrounded_Middle>`__.

There's a subtle issue here that bothers me. It's the phony narrative
arc imposed on a project.

Glen says that "managers talk about beginnings and endings". This is
a -- potentially -- phony narrative arc we're told to wrap around a
project. Some projects are small, clear and have more-or-less
definite beginnings.

Glen also says that "The beginnings are abstract and ambiguous". This
is a more useful reality. The project's official "beginning" is
unrelated to the conversations and decisions in which it actually
began.

Details Details
---------------

The biggest issue with the imposed narrative arc is that it is a
distortion of the real beginning of the project. See "`Aristotle's
Poetics and Project
Management <{filename}/blog/2010/01/2010_01_28-aristotles_poetics_and_project_management.rst>`__"
The official beginning, the kick-off meeting, and the official
project charter may not match the real situation as understood by
accounting (in paying for the project) or the users (in having
expectations) or the product owner (in prioritizing the sprints).

It's risky trying to impose a definite start and charter on a
project. It's likely to be wrong; at the very least it can be
misleading.

The details matter, and imposing a phony narrative arc can elide or
obscure the details.

Better Practice
---------------

Background and context leading up to a project are very, very
important and shouldn't be elided. While *every* little detail in the
entire lead-up to a project isn't helpful, what is interesting is
changing the concept of *inception* of a project.

From the first conversations, we should stop looking at all projects
as discrete, unified things with a Beginning, Middle and End. Some
projects may be discrete, but many software development projects will
have a large backlog, numerous deliverables, constant upgrades,
improvements and "maintenance" and will be a career move more than a
project.

We have to realize that the very first, preliminary conversations
about software involve a prioritized backlog of feature requests.

Later, when we try to impose our standard narrative framework, and
have a kick-off meeting, we already understand the project as a
series of sprints to build some things. The "deliverables" are ranked
from most valuable to least valuable.

Don't Create a Middle
---------------------

Honesty about the lack of a clear start allows us -- from the very
beginning -- more latitude to rethink and re-prioritize. There is no
separate moment when clarity sets in. It was always clear that the
end-state was "enough" software, not "all of these features and
nothing but these features". We avoid the ungrounded middle, and it's
emotional low-point.

We avoid the ungrounded middle because we don't impose a phony
narrative arc on the enterprise. We can be much more clear that we're
involved in a sequence of sprints. We can pace ourselves for the long
haul.
