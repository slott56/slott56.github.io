In an organization with more than one layer of management, the default
answer must be "no". Folks get needlessly frustrated by this. But it's a
logical consequence of multiple layers of management.

Consider that direction must come *down* from above. If you're
suggesting something *up* to your manager (or in your role as an
outsider) the response must be "no". What you're suggesting is not
the direction that came from above.

If any manager not at the top says "yes" to you -- an underling our
outsider -- they've just committed an act of insubordination to their
actual manager.

All managers in positions other than the apex, must say "no" or be
insubordinate. And the top manager has "outside pressure" to say
"no". Approval is largely impossible to obtain except at the very
top.

Variations on the Theme
-----------------------

A "no" can come in a variety of forms.

For organizations that are CMM level 1, it's simply "no", without
much justification. All ideas that didn't come down from above are
inappropriate or unfunded or simply "not on our radar".

For organizations in CMM level 2, there are more complex and
ritualistic forms of "no". Often they are filtered by "if it makes
business sense." However, making business sense is largely
impossible. Marketing doesn't have to jump through elaborate hoops to
justify spending money on advertising. They mostly just do using
vague back-of-the envelope justification.

For CMM level 3 or higher organizations, there's an approval
*process*, that will net a big old "no" after a lot of work following
the defined process.

What Gets Done?
---------------

Generally, ideas that come down from the top have a pre-approved
"yes". After all, what comes from above was already in this year's
budget. It was scheduled for this year. The schedule is sacred.

In a CMM 1 organization, you just do what you're told. In CMM 2
organization, there's some kind of "management" veneer wrapped around
the word from on high. In CMM 3 organizations, there's a process to
rubber-stamp the stuff that's trickles down from the top to be rubber
stamped.

Process doesn't always help. Projects that are ill-defined -- but a
pet project of a development director or CIO -- will still be vetted
and approved. Projects that come from outside IT are often "more
valuable" and get more ready approval, even though there are no more
details in those project descriptions.

Projects that bubble up from below, however, have to be be rejected.
They weren't in the budget.

Fixing The Approval Process
---------------------------

You pretty much can't fix the approval process. Taking things
upstairs to your manager is -- generally -- insubordination. You
weren't told to do it, so you're wasting your time, time that could
be spent on things that were in the budget for this year.

You can be lucky enough to work for an organization that has little
or no management. Such "entrepreneurial" organizations are
characterized by more "yes" than "no"; more importantly an
entrepreneurial simply has very little management. (Nothing is
funnier than training managers to be entrepreneurial. You want
entrepreneurial? Make the managers actually write code.)

The only thing you can do in a large organization is to take
hostages. If it's a good enough idea, you have to start doing it
anyway. Once people catch you at it, then you have to explain what a
good idea it it. It will be an uphill fight all the way. No one will
ever "greenlight" your idea.

If you're doing the right thing, it may be a struggle, and you will
be in trouble until it appears in next year's budget. Then someone
else will be assigned to it.

Interestingly, it more-or-less must work this way. Sadly, smart
technical people are often unhappy with this. They either don't want
to fight for their ideas, or fight too stridently for them. There's a
happy medium in the middle of pushing a good idea without alienating
managers that are forced to reject what is obviously a good idea.
