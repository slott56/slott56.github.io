The readers of the Building Skills Books have a number of needs:

#.  A way to post errors and corrections. I get a *lot* of these.
    Thanks!

#.  A way to share comments and questions. I get a fair number of
    these.

A Google Group seems to be the best approach. We have pages,
discussions, email notifications, a lot of features.

As long as we're opening the group, I figured I should actually
make the dozens of corrections that have been sent in. Also, I'm
looking closely at using `Lulu <http://www.lulu.com/>`__ to handle
hard-copy production for the folks that have asked for that.
