Got a nice email about *architecture* -- but the wrong kind.

It was about physical structures, not software.

It is a "bucket-list" of buildings one simply *must* see. `100
Amazing Buildings Every Architecture Buff Should
See <http://constructionmanagementdegree.org/?page_id=459>`__. A cool
list to have handy.

I know bupkes about buildings. I've lived in them for all my life,
I've even owned a few. But that's about it. I'm more interested in
marine architecture and knowing how my boat is put together. [My
boat was designed by `Ted Brewer <http://www.tedbrewer.com/>`__;
that's the kind of architecture I'm interested in.]

Despite my utter ignorance of buildings, I am very aware that the
Software Design Patterns folks were heavily influenced by
Christopher Alexander's work on patterns in architecture. For the
parallels, read this by Doug Lea, `Christopher Alexander:An
Introduction for Object-Oriented
Designers <http://g.oswego.edu/dl/ca/ca/ca.html#node6>`__.

Retronyms
---------

When the "electric guitar" was perfected, folks had to create a
new word to replace "guitar". The word had become ambiguous, and
the phrase "acoustic guitar" was invented to disambiguate
"guitar".

We have the same problem with architecture. There's software
architecture, marine architecture, and "unqualified" architecture.
Worse, we're unlikely to get a good retronym because architecture
is a pretty well-defined profession (like "doctor", "dentist" or
"barber") and you can't easily rename it.
