Check out "`End User 2.0: When Employees Have All The
Answers <http://www.informationweek.com/news/telecom/collaboration/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=227300081>`__"
in InformationWeek. This is about adoption of non-approved technology.
Think iPad.

This shows what innovation looks like when it happens.

1.  There's no process for innovation.

2.  There's no "permission to fail". Folks just fail or succeed
    without anyone's support or permission.

3.  It's disruptive. Many IT departments don't know how to cope with
    USB drives, iPads and related leading-edge technology. So these
    things are simply banned. (Ever walked past a sign that says "No
    Recording Devices Allowed Beyond This Point" with your iPhone?)

Here's one great quote: "Policies around regulatory compliance,
reliability, budget approvals, and support all give IT teams reasons
to resist technology driven by end users."

Technology innovation is happening. It is disruptive. Therefore, IT
tends to resist the disruption.

The best stall tactic: "Security". If IT lifts up security as an
issue, they can resist technology innovation effectively.

**Other Disruptive Change**

This happens everywhere. It isn't just the iPad. All disruptive,
innovative change is met with serious resistance.

Agile Methods. Some IT departments resist agile methods because --
obviously -- the lack of a comprehensive and detailed project plan is
a problem. Failure to plan is a plan for failure. The idea of
building intentional flexibility into predicting the future is
rejected. It's too disruptive to the IT chain of command to reduce
the need for project managers.

Dynamic or Functional Programming Languages. It was painful to adopt
Java (or C#). Adopting another, different language like Python is
insanity. Obviously. Anyone in "Big IT" who is a serious Java or C#
developer can tell you that a dynamic language is obviously
unsuitable for production use. Mostly, the reasons boil down to "it's
different"; different is too disruptive.

N0SQL Data Management. Clearly, the relational database is the only
form of persistence that can possibly be used. It is perfect in every
way. It can be used as a message queue (because adopting an actual
message queue is too much work). It can be used for temporary or
transient data. It can be used for non-relational objects like XML
documents. Any suggestion that we use something other than a database
is often met with derision. Clearly, a non-SQL database is disruptive
to the orderly flow of data.

Simplified Architecture. [This is code for "No Stored Procedures".]
Since stored procedures have been used with mixed success, some folks
argue that they should be used more. On the other hand, it seems
peculiar to me to intentionally fork application logic into two
places -- application code and database. It seems to add complexity
with no value. Lots of DBA's try to explain that some logic is
"lower-level" or "more closely associated with the data" or "is a
more 'essential' business rule." There's no dividing line here that
makes stored procedures necessary or useful.

Try to prevent the problems associated with stored procedures and you
will receive a $#!+-storm of abuse. Every time. Reducing the use of
stored procedures is a disruptive change. An innovation. A bad thing.

[Want proof of the non-essential nature of stored procedures? Watch
what happens when to upgrade or replace an application and migrate
your data. Did you need the stored procedures? No, you left those
behind. You only kept the data.]
