In time for your Holiday Reading.
Want guidance on OO design in Python?
Want a **lot** of concrete examples, fully tested?

- Master OOP fundamentals with hands-on examples and expert insights
- Learn design patterns and type hinting with real-world Python 3.13 code
- Develop scalable programs using testing and concurrency best practices

I can't emphasize the testing enough. Too many folks learn to code without really being required to create unit test cases.

This book is a significant rewrite to the previous edition.
We've chopped some of the less interesting material on the way the built-in classes work to focus on design patterns and how they need to be implemented in Python.
