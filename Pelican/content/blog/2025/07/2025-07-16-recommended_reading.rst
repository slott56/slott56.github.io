Q: "Can you recommend  books that are good for a beginner wanting to learn python?"

Me: "Depends on the person’s background..."

Q: "They has a deep background in the problem domain. Recently they've been doing a lot of reporting and analytics using SQL."

Okay. That's excellent.

One of the best books is “automate the hard stuff with Python” by Al Sweigart.
See https://automatetheboringstuff.com/

I’ve got a very small ebook on the exact topic of stepping away from SQL to embrace Python:
See https://slott56.github.io/2024-08-20-unlearning_sql.html

And see https://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2025/unlearning-sql.html for a video on moving from SQL to Python.

Finally, the killer toolset for this kind of thing is Jupyter Lab.
