We test software.
We test people.

My lawyer, all my various doctors, even the coffee bar on main street is subject to testing.
The coffee shop proudly posts their score from health inspections.
Want to know about food safety? Ask them.

My professionals all have walls full of diplomas and certifications.
You know, credentials.

They can speak with authority on certain topics.
They've been tested by boards and experts in their field.

My daughter-in-law has a PhD.
This means she's been subject to rigorous testing by other experts in her chosen field.

The crap AI in my browser?

Any testing? Any certification? Any credentials? Any diploma? Any endorsements?

What? nothing?

An AI without a stack of diplomas is no better than a drunk bloviating in a bar.
I there was a stack of diplomas, I'd consider venturing a question in one of the diploma subject areas.
Otherwise?
Without rigorous testing by other experts?
