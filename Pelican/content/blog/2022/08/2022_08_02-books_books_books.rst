First, there's

Pivot to Python
###############

A Guide for professionals and skilled beginners
-----------------------------------------------

I've recently updated this to fix some cosmetic problems with title
pages, the table of contents and stuff like that. The content hasn't
changed. Yet. It's still an introduction to Python for folks who already
know how to program, they want to pivot to programming in Python.
Quickly.

But wait, there's more.

Unlearning SQL
###############

When your only tool is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail
----------------------------------------------------------------

This is all new. It's written for folks who know Python, and are
struggling with the architectural balance between writing bulk
processing in SQL or writing it in Python. For too many developers, SQL
is effectively the only tool they can use. With a variety of tools, it
becomes easier to solve a wider variety of problems.
