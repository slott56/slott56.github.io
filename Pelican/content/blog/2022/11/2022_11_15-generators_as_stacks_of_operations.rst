I'm delighted by this article.

I was shown only the first, horrible, example. I think the idea was to
push back on the idea of complex generators. I fumed.

Then I read the entire article.

Now I'm fuming at someone who posted the first example -- apparently
having failed to read the rest of the post.

This idea of building a stack of iterators is very, very good.

The example (using simple operations) can be misleading. A follow-on
example doing something like file parsing might be helpful. But, if you
go too far, you wind up writing an entire book about Functional
Programming in Python.
