This is bonus content for the forthcoming `Functional Python Programming
3rd
edition <https://www.packtpub.com/product/functional-python-programming-third-edition/9781803232577>`__
book. It didn't make it into the book because -- well -- it was just too
much of the wrong kind of detail.

See this "`Tough
TCO <https://itmaybeahack.com/buildingskills/Tough_TCO.pdf>`__" document
for some thoughts on Tail-Call Optimization that can be particularly
difficult. This isn't terribly original, but I think it's helpful for
folks working through more complex problems from a functional
perspective.

   "Why a PDF?" I've been working with with LaTeX, and the switching to
   other ways of editing and presenting code seemed like too much work.
