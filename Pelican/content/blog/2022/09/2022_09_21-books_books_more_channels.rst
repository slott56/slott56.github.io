I started with the Apple Books platform because it's an easy default for
me.

Pivot to Python
===============

A Guide for professionals and skilled beginners
-----------------------------------------------

https://books.apple.com/us/book/pivot-to-python/id1586977675

I've recently updated this to fix some cosmetic problems with title
pages, the table of contents and stuff like that. The content hasn't
changed. Yet. It's still an introduction to Python for folks who already
know how to program, they want to pivot to programming in Python.
Quickly.

But wait, there's more.

Unlearning SQL
==============

When your only tool is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail
----------------------------------------------------------------

Many folks know some Python, but struggle with the architectural balance
between writing bulk processing in SQL or writing it in Python. For too
many developers, SQL is effectively the only tool they can use. With a
variety of tools, it becomes easier to solve a wider variety of problems
effectively.

Google Play
-----------

Now, I'm duplicating the books on Google Play. Here's **Unlearning
SQL**:

I've made a clone of **Pivot to Python**, also.

https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Steven_F_Lott_Unlearning_SQL?id=23WAEAAAQBAJ&hl=en_US&gl=US

Both books are (intentionally) short to help experts make rapid
progress.
