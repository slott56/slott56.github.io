SubUnit's http://www.robertcollins.net/unittest/subunit/ purpose appears to be to manage testing
via subprocesses.



Consequently, it can run external tests not in Python, it can fork a subprocess to manage the Fixture
in an isolated process.



Adding this subprocess execution context extends the **Test Runner**  implementation of the built-in
``unittest`` module.  This can be useful in contexts where the Fixture includes **Singletons**
or connection pools or other per-process design features.
