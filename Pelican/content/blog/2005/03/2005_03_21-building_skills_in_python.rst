I originally wrote this in Appleworks. 
Easy, easy, easy.  However, it was also free from semantic
markup.



It took 3 months to
convert from Appleworks to DocBook, edit, and clean up the presentation.  I also
fixed the outline and revamped the material to upgrade it to Python 2.3. 




Whew. 




Cover art doesn't look great,
but it works for now.
