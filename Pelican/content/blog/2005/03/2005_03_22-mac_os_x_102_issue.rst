Mac OS X 10.2 (which I have) has an older
JVM, which has a thread termination bug, which makes Xalan not work.  However,
it does have XLSTPROC.



So, I
can't use Xalan for Docbook, without upgrading to 10.3.  And with 10.4 (a/k/a
Tiger) coming out soon, I'll have to wait a bit for the complete upgrade package
from Apple Inc.  Until then, I'll plug away with Windows :-(
