She has some
interesting notes on CMS.  However, when we get down to brass tacks, something
profound is missing.  She hints around at it with the
following.

"Don’t overlook the "people
factor." Even though the new content management system may offer great benefits
to the enterprise and to individual users, most people don’t like to
change the way they work. A system that requires them to drastically change the
process of creating content will be met with resistance by many -- perhaps most
-- users unless you can convince them that there’s really something in it
for them."



The unasked questions are:
Who Has The Problem?  and What Problem Do They
Have?



In order to make CMS useful (or
even interesting), it has to solve someone's problem.  The problems that CMS
solves could be numerous, but often aren't.  We have file systems, and they
mostly work.  We need to be more specific on what file systems don't do, and why
spending money on CMS is better than doing nothing about
CMS.



While a litany of features can be
helpful, the article doesn't identify a problem very well.
