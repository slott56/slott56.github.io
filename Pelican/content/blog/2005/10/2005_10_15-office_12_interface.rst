This is a real `C|net <http://news.com.com/Office+12+makeover+takes+on+feature+creep/2100-1012_3-5873597.html?tag=st.prev>`_   thought provoker on the Office 12 changes
that may come with Vista (or whatever they're calling Longhorn this
year).



See `Coding Horror <http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000397.html>`_   for a view of Office 12.  `Signal vs. Noise <http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/microsoft_office_12_screen_shots.php>`_   has some
thoughts.



The bad thing is the
following apology for a bloated application that is nearly incomprehensible:
Jakob Nielsen's `Alertbox <http://www.useit.com/alertbox/wysiwyg.html>`_   for October 10.




I think it's time to switch to `Open
Office <http://www.openoffice.org>`_ .
