Here are three additional levels of numerology
that just don't belong the discipline of software
architecture.



**Empiricism**. Ideally these are from Physics and related "hard" sciences.  Psychology or
Economics are "hard" sciences in the other sense of hard -- they're difficult
because of the subject matter.  The magic number 7 Â± 2, for example, is a
piece of research [`miller <http://www.well.com/user/smalin/miller.html>`_ ] that has some standing.  There's some
fuzziness to this, and a change in theory or measurement or sample population
could refine
this.



**Mysticism**. The idea that every industry is dominated by three major players, or that there
are five layers to a good architecture is just mysticism.  They are comfortable
numbers, they form patterns in our heads, but they aren't natural "laws", or
even empirical
measurements.



**Tautologies**. A logical tautology can be framed with numbers to make it seem empirical.  "If
the solution/consequence does not directly (ie no more than 1 logic jump) tie
back to the problem, then something is wrong somewhere."  More than one logic
jump is just a faux-empirical code for "non-sequitur" or "not directly". 




Let's test "more than 1 logic jump". 
What it if were more than, say, 3 logic jumps?  Would that be more or less of an
indirect thread of logic?  Since it would be equally baffling, the number 1 has
no real significance, and is just
numerology.

JB Says:



I found this particular rant and your associated personal forum article kind of bothersome.
Counting for me is often a way of beginning to make sense when I'm otherwise
lost. So, I pondered for a bit, until an insight appeared. It's not about
counting. It's about hypothesys formation. It's about doing
science.



So, when I'm lost and go start counting things I have no idea what the numbers gathered mean.
That's the point, actually. The numbers become additional chunks to mix around
and try to find or make some meaning, 27 fizbins observed each day except
alternate Tuesdays, when there are literally hundreds. Interesting. Something is
different here between alternate Tuesdays and the other days at least as regards
fizbins. Now one can begin positing this explanation or that, and testing
them.



"Well, perhaps all fizbins have a genetic, cognitive disorder which wires in the twin
compulsions of exhibitionsim an an attraction to Tuesdays. Unlikely, as fizbins
have no DNA, not being creatures, and are never seen around calendars so they
can't know what day it is."



"Is there something interesting about alternate Tuesdays?"



The folly of counting stuff we don't already understand comes not from the counting, but from
whipping on the numbers an unrealized belief in some silly, weak, uncontemplated
model of the world. Too often the same presumed models are used again and again
without  even realizing  that they are being used. "More is better." "More input
makes more output."

Etc.



I don't think it's
the counting, so much as the absence of the perspective and the discipline to do
science, even in a lightweight manner, with whatever small aspect of the mundane
world we decide to count.
