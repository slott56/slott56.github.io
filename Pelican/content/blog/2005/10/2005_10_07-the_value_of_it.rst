"Since
IT rarely drives the revenue of the business, its policies are little more than
lines in the sand at low tide."

for the "IT uses ROI, but no one else
does" conversation.  I'll summarize some of
it.



IT's focus on ROI can often stifle
business investment in the technology.  IT can stop the business cold by
trivializing technical innovation as an ROI-creating activity.  A great deal of
marketing and communication has no ROI; why should IT invent
road-blocks?



"The question that I still
have is doesn't marketing need to show ROI
?"



No.  They don't.  Marketing sells
product.  That's their value proposition.  Measuring ROI isn't appropriate. 
It's only a coping mechanism for IT.  It isn't good business management, in
general.

I'll summarize some of it.



IT
intentionally makes short-sighted
decisions.

I Think This is Over-Compensating
Because They Don't Look At Themselves As A Profit-Center.
