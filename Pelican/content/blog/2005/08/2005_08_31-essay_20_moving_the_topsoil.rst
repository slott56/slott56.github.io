The topsoil is in the front yard, the garden is
in the back yard.



The users form up a
bucket brigade to use several pails and buckets to move the soil.  It's
backbreaking and slow, so they go to IT for a
solution.



"We've measured the work
activity very carefully, and we need shovels that are precisely sized for our
buckets," the users say.  "We were careful not to specify the technical details,
we just wrote up these business requirements that say, in effect, we need a
right-sized shovel.  But we didn't specify the technical details because we know
that adds cost and risk to the
project."



IT architects look the
situation over and counter-offer with a one-hand scoopy-bucket which does both
the soil scooping and transporting in one single wonder of sheet metal and
spot-welding.  



The CIO looks at the
proposal and complains that there isn't sufficient return on investment to
design and build the scoopy-bucket.  First, no one can be spared from the
maintenance activities that are so vital to day-to-day operations.  Second, this
doesn't have any provision for disaster recovery or business continuity.  It
probably won't pass a SAS-70 audit.  Third, it involves new technology and new
skills and doesn't fit with the strategic direction.  Since the strategic
direction uses more rakes, they have to rework the entire plan to be rake-based
not bucket-based.



The architects hack
out a modification to the existing raking systems, called a Rake-O-Filler.  They
will purchase an off the shelf bucket, and the modify it so heavily that it is
unrecognizable and call it the Lift-O-Land.  The resulting integrated system
(ROFLOL) that should do some of the job that the users requested.  They'll still
need to change their bucket brigade strategy, however, because it takes three
people to fill, and only one to
carry.



The programmers take twice as
long as scheduled to build the Rake-O-Filler.  The project manager controlling
the modifications to Lift-O-Land reworks the specifications so that it does
almost the entire job, making the Rake-O-Filler almost unnecessary. 
Unfortunately, the Lift-O-Land is now so slow that the bucket brigade  isn't
really effective.  Instead, people take turns running a bucket of soil when it
is filled.



The users request a
"Bucket-Runner-Scheduler" to help allow the bucket runners to do more useful
work until a bucket is filled.  The architects suggest using the calendar in
MS-Outlook.  The security manager doesn't like the idea of a shared calendar in
a desktop tool that could be vulnerable to hacking.  The architects suggest an
open-source shared-calendar application in PHP that's free, but the CIO and the
security manager won't permit open source
solutions.



The management consultant
asks, "Why not have a second load delivered to the back yard?" 




The CIO bellows that she doesn't want
to pay for the topsoil twice.
