Here's a possible match-up between the Seven
Deadly Sins and Seven Species of Complexity.

-   lust for someone we cannot have - "When I Grow Up"

-   gluttony or over-indulgence - "How Hard Can It Be?"

-   avarice (covetousness, greed) for things
    we do not need - "Quality vs. Quantity of Ideas"

-   sloth (laziness, idleness) wasting time -
    "If I Had A Hammer"

-   wrath (anger) - "Conflict is the Story"

-   envy (jealousy) resentment of others for
    their possessions - "Form vs. Structure"

-   pride (vanity) - "Fear of Showing Weakness"



Lust and Envy don't match up
well - there isn't a strong parallel here.  Neither list is a canonical
decomposition of mistakes and evils.  Further, there is a strong emotional
content to the seven sins which isn't really present in software development
projects.  



Perhaps the 7 virtues
(humility, meekness, charity, chastity, moderation, zeal and generosity) provide
guidance on overcoming the culture of complexity?
