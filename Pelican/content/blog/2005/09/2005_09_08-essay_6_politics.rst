Politics are the lifeblood of requirements
gathering.  For architecture, they are important, but don't as often take center
stage.



Requirements are about the
actors, their goals and motivations, and their interactions with some potential
system.  People are political, and the presence or absence of certain
requirements, certain turns of phrase is all part of the
process.



I like to bracket the
"Institutional Bias," also.  I often call it the "preference" in written
communications.  This is a nod to the ways things always work around here.  Many
times, this is termed "the real world," as in "that may be a good idea, but in
the real world, no one would ever do it that
way."



It's hard to respond when someone
tries to play the "real world" card.  This is often played by people who won't
adapt to a better process or deliverable.  You find yourself being the different
drummer and try to get them to march to the new beat, which may be an exercise
in futility. 



You can try to play the
"new reality" card.  Some people will respond to this, acknowledging that the
reason they are building application software is to create a new real world in
which the old preferences and limitations are
removed.



However, this is a war that
must be won one heart at a time.  A long struggle, especially for outsider
consultants.



The architecture,
similarly, must often bow to skill set, experience, and novelty constraints. 
While many people may be perfectly happy with MySQL under Linux, there are still
many more who will bracket it as unproven, risky and
dangerous.



I've heard good old Unix
called "too new and too risky".  This was back in the 90's, when UNIX was over
20 years old.  But, to someone who had never seen it before, it was too new to
consider.
