The thesis is that the first step in solving a
problem is stating it.  It's hard to argue with that, but people
do.



Here are all some ways that people
have made stating a problem as difficult as possible.  

1.  Complain that there are too many steps in the
    methodology.  For example: (1) state the problem, (2) brainstorm solutions, (3)
    use the solution as the inception of a project, (4) elaborate the analysis, (5)
    design and implement and (6) transition for production use.  Since this is more
    than two steps, it is too many.

#.  Complain that methodologies limit
    creativity/insight/flexibility/whatever.  Refuse to pursue any structured
    approach.

#.  Simply refuse to define the problem without
    providing much of an explanation.  Things like "That isn't the number one
    priority" are great ways to rephrase simple refusal as if it is merely a
    question of priorities.  Everything that isn't priority one will never get done,
    and putting problem definition below #1 on the list of things do to damns it to
    eternal avoidance.

#.  Complain that it is hard to define a problem. 
    For example, "It's easier to hack out a prototype than define the problem we are
    solving".  

#.  Complain that there is no point to defining
    the problem.  We can, for example, insist that there is no ROI on defining the
    problem, all the ROI accrues from solving the problem.

#.  Complain that defining the problem requires
    interaction.  It's not clear exactly how this is "bad".  It appears that problem
    solving (like programming) is a solitary experience: we discuss briefly with the
    users, then run away to our Fortress of Solitude to invent a solution which we
    briefly discussed.  Unwillingly, we engage in weekly/monthly/quarterly progress
    meetings.  The idea of negotiating over the context, problem, costs and values
    seems to be pointless, since it isn't the solutions, it's just
    talk.

#.  Complain that budgets are sacrosanct.  It's
    not clear what this means.  Perhaps this means that taking time to define the
    problem will derail an improper or ill-advised solution that's already in
    process.  Note the sequence of events implied by this objection:  (1) we're
    already "solving" the "problem", now you want us to (2) formally define the
    "problem"?  That might invalidate the "solution", already in
    progress.

#.  Complain that problem definition requires
    people to admit that they made a mistake.  I don't understand this at all, but
    some people are very, very sensitive to the possibility of problem definition
    being taken as an "attack" on someone who made a "mistake" which we now have to
    "fix".  Okay.  Can we move beyond the fear that there might be childish name
    calling?  It's not like we actually have any name-calling; the objection is that
    recognition of a problem may be
    *perceived* 
    as name-calling and finger-pointing.

#.  Complain that it's difficult because an
    individual (a single human being; one person) might wander from the original
    problem to other problems.  With a committee, this is a very real issue.  But
    for a single key user?  If there isn't a problem that is bothering them...
    well... there isn't a problem.  If they can't say "fix this and I'll be
    satisfied," that's an important cultural or organizational issue.   Clearly, it
    isn't technical, and doesn't deserve much more than professional
    counseling.

#.  Conflate the solution with the problem and
    describe the solution.



I see three
parallel activities as part of this concentrated avoidance effort: ignore it,
evade it, and pervert it.



One **ignores** it by pretending a problem statement isn't required.  This is the most blatant
denial of the value.  A specification of the solution will do.  Lacking any
definition of success, scope creep or dissatisfaction are
inevitable.



One **evades** it by acknowledging that there may be some potential value, but assigning all
other activities a higher priority.  This is a more subtle denial of the value,
but the effect is the same: the tacit assumption of a problem means unclear or
divergent definitions of success, which leads to scope creep or dissatisfaction
or both.



One **perverts** it by twisting around the meaning of "problem" to include solution-oriented
concepts.  In this case, we're urged to write very complex "problem" statements
that include technology and business constraints "so they won't be forgotten"
during the process of solving the problem.  This is absurd.  The technology
constraints aren't part of the problem and they won't be forgotten unless the
entire project team wins the lottery and leaves with no forwarding
address.
