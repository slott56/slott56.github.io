In the spring (I wish I wrote down the dates for
this sequence of events) I bought my 5-pack for 10.4 "Tiger".  (Think of Rod
Steiger and the Highway Patrol TV show with him leaning on a late 50's car
rasping "10-4" into a police radio.)



I upgraded the old iMac (#1) and things went great.  Backup, upgrade, restore
selected items, archive the backup:
flawless.



Mac #2, however, won't
upgrade.  The installer says that the S.M.A.R.T. status on this hard drive is
"failing" and it needs to be replaced.  Yet, of course, the hard drive works and
works flawlessly.



So I tried every disk
repair trick there is.  I even used old Mac OS 9 "fix anything" utilities from
La Cie to try and fix anything.  The S.M.A.R.T. status is part of the hardware
and won't be reset.



I'm basically
trapped with having the hard drive pulled and replaced.  I can then install
Tiger on an otherwise virgin machine. 




What about my files?  They're on the
old hard drive.  I got a Fire-Wire to IDE enclosure `firewire_case_kits <http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/firewire/firewire_case_kits/>`_,
dropped the drive in there and I'm back on line.



What did I lose?  Well, it
looks like a new machine, so .MAC is baffled by my backup/restore and iSync
requests.  And, I had to reinstall many things.  I had to repurchase some
licenses because I'd lost the keys.
