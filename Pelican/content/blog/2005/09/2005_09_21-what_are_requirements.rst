See Holub's column "Requirements Gathering"
[`Requirements Gathering <http://www.sdtimes.com/fullcolumn/column-20050915-02.html>`_ ] for the goods on what is actually useful
and what isn't so useful in this activity we call "Requirements
Gathering".



I have to applaud the
notion that "focus on the minutiae" misses the whole point.  A clear problem
statement is perhaps more important that anything else, and the "requirements"
are often negotiable, depending on the problem and the nature of the
solution.



In `"Analysis Without Running Aground" <{filename}/blog/2005/09/2005_09_17-essay_13_analysis_without_running_aground.rst>`_
I tried to capture this sense of define
the problem first.  I've got many war stories on this subject.  Over the next
month or so, I hope to get many of these off my chest in into this
Blog.



Having Holub's clearly-stated
version of my opinion is a real help.
