Check this out for a new model of software
development.  Why hire full-time developers when your business is not software
development?  Why rent contract labor?  Why not just buy the custom
software?



Note that your own internal
QA processes have to be top-shelf to do this.  Internal staff can screw up and
you can shift deadlines, reduce the promises and otherwise fudge.  If your
specifications are shoddy, and you get a shoddy product, then you permitted a
shoddy contractor to work to your shoddy specifications.  You still hold most of
the blame for cost overruns and
problems.



Consider many small
deliverables with incremental payments so that you can "pull the plug" when
things don't go the way you
imagined.
