Walker Royce notes that the early parts of a
project involve discovery; as a consequence the scope is subject to change.  He
calls the early phases inception and elaboration.  Inception identifies the need
for a project, and stakes out an initial context and problem.  Elaboration adds
details, including the constraining forces and a candidate
solution.



During the early phases, the
scope can and should change.  The scope changes as information is gathered, and
the understanding of context, problem and forces
changes.



Often, the inception begins
with an operational concept, not a definite problem.  As the problem and context
are refined, the scope will appear to creep.  What really happens is that the
operational concept is teased apart into problem (functional and non-functional
requirements) and solution.  As the elements separate, the requirements are
refined into a clean statement of the problem, and the solution is also refined
to be a solution to that
problem.



Another kind of scope creep
occurs when different solutions are proposed to resolve the problem.  Each
proposed solution may uncover additional requirements, further refining the
problem.  It is sometimes difficult to both brainstorm solutions and document
the requirements uncovered during
brainstorming.



For example, it may
appear that networked storage is required to make a knowledge base widely
accessible.  However, it may also be possible to replicate the knowledge base
whenever an approved change is made.  Since both solutions are possible
candidates, other constraints must be examined to choose between the two. 
Problem attributes like the frequency or volume of updates, of the nature of
shared document authoring may help to promote one solution over
another.



One of the desirable
attributes of an architecture is the flexibility to move elements around in the
structure.  The isolation of responsibility and use of standard interfaces
promotes flexibility in tailoring the solution to the actual problem and
context.



The issue is to correctly
label the work activity.  It is exploration of the problem?  Is it exploration
of the solution?  If you never had a problem statement to begin with, how do you
know what the scope of the investigation should be?
