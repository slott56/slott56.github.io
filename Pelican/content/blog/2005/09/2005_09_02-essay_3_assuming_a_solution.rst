A great deal of the requirements analysis
activity is identifying the entire problem.  Many software people are eager to
present a solution to some of the
problem.



Perhaps I can't locate my
keys.  Having a "Clapper" on my key ring so that my keys chirp may be a
solution.  However, if the real problem is that my keys were in my car when it
was stolen, the Clapper isn't really part of a solution to the actual
problem.



Another example that is common
is "reducing network traffic".  This is often stated as a requirement, as if
this has merit in its own right. 



This
is a "non-functional" requirement.  It is part of resource use or performance,
and should be clearly identified as such.  It has nothing to do with the
behavior of  the software; it doesn't help to meet the actor's goals or
objectives except in a peripheral way of not being slow.  The real requirement,
then is for some timeline or performance objective, irrespective of the chosen
solution.



Network traffic may not be
part of the problem or the solution.  Stating it in the requirements makes the
assumption that a network will be part of the solution.  This assumption may be
false, and may also needlessly constrain thinking of actual solutions to the
actual problem.



Often, a needless
constraint appears on the scene because the actual problem is incompletely
defined.  Assuming a network in the solution may be because the context was not
clearly stated, or the actual problem was not identified.




Typically, the solution is assumed
because the problem appears to be a weakness in the existing technology.  The
fix, then is a patch or revision to that specific technology-related
problem.



I might, for example, find
myself too far from my keys to get my "Clapper" to respond.  My engineer then
builds a wireless web-based device with an integrated Global Positioning System
(GPS) that posts the exact location of my keys on the Internet.  I still have to
translate this information to a specific spot within my house, but that is only
more technology.  The real problem is that I leave my keys in my car with the
engine running when I go to the liquor store in crime-ridden
neighborhoods.



The real problem has
still not been identified, but a great deal of technology has been designed
based on a great many technical assumptions.
