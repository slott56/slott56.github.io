Software, and a software architecture, is a
solution to a problem.  Without a specific problem, software is a pointless
exercise:  statements in a formal language with no thesis or purpose.  An
abstract piece of software akin to the statement: "Time flies like an arrow." 
It parses (two different ways!) but doesn't solve a
problem.



The central issues, then
are



1.  Identifying the problem

#.  Developing a solution

#.  Describing the solution



Here, we'll look closely at
the description of the solution.  The description, like any story, establishes a
context or setting (time and place); it peoples this place with actors who have
goals and objectives.  A good story creates drama by putting the actors in
conflict with each other or their setting.  The characters typically evolve and
change, making moral choices, and eventually resolving their conflict.  There
are, in a good story, consequences to this resolution.  In a movie, these
consequences comprise the "third act," and are sometimes overlooked or
ignored.



We have, then a general
pattern for story telling:



*   Context

*   Problem

*   Forces

*   Solution

*   Consequences



Note that this is a good
order, but not the only order.  Films will interleave the elements of context
and problem during the first act.  Some characters (representing the forces to
be resolved) may also be introduced during the second act.  The solution may be
hinted at from the very beginning, or introduced as a twist at the
end.



Given this framework or pattern,
we can craft a compelling description of a software solution to a problem. 
Consider what happens when we omit elements of the narrative
structure.



Omit the Context.   The
reader knows the problem, but may not understand why it is a problem.  The
necessary background is, of course, the context; it does not have to be
presented first, but is essential to understanding the problem.  Generally, the
context is a fixed background against which the problem is solved: it is often a
phsyical, legal and social fabric.



Omit
the Problem.  The reader may say, "nice algorithm but why do I care?"  The
visionary project plan includes budget, staffing, tools, schedule, but not hint
as to why we are doing this.



Omit the
Forces.  Given the problem and the solution, descriptions of the forces seem
redundant.  However, without the resolution of various forces, it may not be
clear why this solution is the best solution.  Most problems have a large number
of solutions, including "ignore it."  What is essential is the description of
why the other solutions are impossible or inappropriate.  This shows how the
solution optimizes all of the competing
forces.



Note that when the forces do
not compete, there is no problem.  Sometimes, this needs to be carefully and
clearly explained.  People often propose to build needless or redundant software
because they have failed to recognize all of the forces and provide adequate
resolution.



Omit the Solution.  This is
rare, but not impossible.  Failing to describe the solution means that it was
taken for granted, somehow, and didn't bear to be repeated.  Looking back on
projects in the past and trying to justify ongoing funding or future development
is made more difficult when the obvious is not stated just once for the record. 
The reader is left with a description of a problem, and perhaps consequences
from some unstated solution, but no clear vision of the solution
itself.



Omit the Consequences.  This is
not as severe a problem as omitting other parts of the story.  If the forces and
solution are presented fully, this may be obvious and not bear repeating. 
Leaving the consequences implicit may leave the reader unable to understand
project plan details, costs or schedule required to create the solution.  As
with the problem, it is most important to state the consequences "once, for the
record."
