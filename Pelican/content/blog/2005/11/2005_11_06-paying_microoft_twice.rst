MS AntiSpyware "free" beta http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/spyware/software/default.mspx.  Also, it appears http://blogs.chron.com/techblog/archives/2005/11/microsoft_antis_1.html to be called Windows
Defender.



eWeek's slavish lack of clue
http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1872253,00.asp; Paul Thurott's lack of clue http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/ms_antispyware_preview.asp; ComputerWorld, too http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,105766,00.html?from=story_package had a sidebar "Plugging the Windows Hole"
which was almost embarrassing. 




Everyone treats this like it's A Good
Thing.  Okay, so MS pays a lot of advertising dollars.  That appears to be why
no one says "**MS Created The Problem** ", or
"**How Is a New Product Necessary?** "  Couldn't we fix the root cause of
of malware: the unapproved installation of software with root-like powers? 
Couldn't we have someone in MS-Land say "No" to installations on-the-fly? 
Couldn't we fix the core OS to simply not do
this?



I find it hard to believe that MS
had to buy a spyware product at bundle it with their OS.  I find it hard to
believe for the following reason.



They
claim that they wrote this "Windows" product.  But they can't seem to locate the
bugs.



Just think about this for a
moment.  (1) They wrote the software.  (2) The software permits malware.  But,
inexplicably, (3) they can't locate the bugs which permit the malware.  They
can't stop the surprise installation of software. 




I read about products that "lock out
spyware" http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,105814,00.html?from=story_package with incredulity.   If MS can't fix the
software they wrote, what does that mean?  They didn't write Windows; or the
people who did write Windows are long gone; or worse, they don't
*want* 
to fix it.  Spyware, it appears, is good for business.  Or, Microsoft found
Windows lying under a rock and can't improve it or even correct
it.



First, MS sells an operating
system.  Not to users, of course, but to Dell, IBM, HP, et. al.  Second, MS
sells patches to fix that operating system.  They sell the fixes to the end
users: a far larger revenue base with no ability to negotiate.  And this also
spins off  an industry of admins, security consultants, hackers and patchers. 
All of which is no-value work that drags away time and money from value-creating
activities.



I can already hear CP
telling me that Microsoft has done great things for the world.  Before MS
Office, desktop integration was a nightmare.  And I have to tell you CP, again,
I'm not talking about their office suite, I'm talking about their bug-filled OS.
And if you say that the bug-filled OS is the barrier to entry for using the
Office Suite, I'll have yet another embarrassing shouting fit in a public place.
So, please, don't bother.  Just download Open Office and stop this -- well --
extortion.
