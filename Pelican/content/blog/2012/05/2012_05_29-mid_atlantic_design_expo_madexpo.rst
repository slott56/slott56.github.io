I'm looking forward to this.  I'll be talking about Python.


-   A Python 3.2 tutorial.  I did a dry run with the help of the 757
    Python group.  Made a bunch of changes based on their input.

-   A more in-depth presentation on a good architecture of Database
    Schema Migration scripts.  You know, the "open heart surgery" of a
    database where the structure changes in some way that's not a
    trivial ALTER statement.
