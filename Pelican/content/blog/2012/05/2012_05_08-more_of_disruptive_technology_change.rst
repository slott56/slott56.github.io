There's a cool infographic on technology change in FrugalDad.  See `The
Great Disruption: The Future of Personal
Tech <http://frugaldad.com/personal-technology/>`__.  It's interesting
and informative, but the few predictions it makes are not really
*disruptive*.  You wouldn't see anyone lobbying against the suggested
future directions.  They're all good ideas that leverage existing
technology.

On the other hand, there's a great graphic that shows how disruptive
technology is labeled as illegal.  See Infographic: `Why the movie
industry is so wrong about
SOPA <http://matadornetwork.com/change/infographic-why-the-movie-industry-is-so-wrong-about-sopa/>`__.

Consider just one example.  Digital Movies.  The DVD was so frightening
to movie producers (or distributors or theaters or the whole supply
chain) that *discussion* of circumvention of DVD encoding had to be made
illegal.  That kind of industry legislative action is evidence that a
technology is truly disruptive.

Disruptive change will often lead to fearful rejection and legislative
action.

"But wait," you say, "no one tried to make the iPod illegal."  Correct.

The iPod is not the *core* disruptive change.  Digital music is the
disruptive change.  The iPod is just a vehicle.  Apple is making their
money by providing a platform for digital content.

If you want to know what the **Next Big Thing** is, look to the US
Congress.  Lobbyists are trying to make some things illegal merely
because they're disruptive.

Universal Health Care, as one example, is being fought against.  There
are lots of specious and farcical reasons being used to argue against
simplifying the insurance mess that has emerged over the last few
decades.  If Congress is fighting against it, that means the following:

1.  It's disruptive.  Game Changing.  Terrifying.

2.  The old school companies are spending huge lobbying and campaign
    budgets to prevent change.  They are unable to adapt to a different set
    of rules.

3.  Some new school companies stand to be *wildly* profitable if the
    change ever gets past the Congressional objections.

For another example, read this brilliant article: `How Ma Bell Shelved
the Future for 60
Years <http://gizmodo.com/5691604/how-ma-bell-shelved-the-future-for-60-years>`__.

This an example of internal censorship of disruptive technology.

    "More precisely, in Bell's imagination, the very knowledge that it was
    possible to record a conversation would "greatly restrict the use of the
    telephone," with catastrophic consequences for its business.

    Businessmen, for instance, the theory supposed, might fear the potential
    use of a recorded conversation to undo a written contract."

You know it's disruptive when it's actively feared.
