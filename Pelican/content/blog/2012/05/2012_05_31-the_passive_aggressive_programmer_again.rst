| I'm not even interested in psychology.  But.  This kind of thing seems
  to come up once in a great while.
| You're asked (or "forced") to work with someone who—essentially—fails
  to cooperate.  They don't actively disagree or actively suggest
  something better.  They passively fail to agree.
| In fact, they probably disagree.  They may actually have an idea of
  their own.
| But they prefer to passively "fail to agree."
| I have little patience to begin with.  And I had noted my personal
  inability to cope in `The Passive-Aggressive Programmer or Why Nothing
  Gets
  Done <http://www.itmaybeahack.com/homepage/iblog/architecture/C551260341/E20071129060000/index.html>`__.
| Recently, I received this.

   "I thought I was going crazy and started doubting myself when dealing
   with a PAP co-worker. I went out on the internet searching for help
   and ran into your blog and its helped me realize that I'm not crazy.
   The example conversations you posted are almost every day occurrences
   here at my job when dealing with my co-worker. From outside of the
   department it was oh those two just butt-heads because I never knew
   how to communicate or point out that really I'm a targeted victim of
   a PAP rather than a butting heads issue. No matter what approach I
   took with the PAP I was doomed and still not quite sure where to go
   from here. Would you happen to offer any advice on how to actually
   deal with PAP? It's driven me to a point where I'm looking for new
   employment because my employer won't deal with it."

| I really have no useful advice.  There's no way to "force" them to
  agree with anything specific.  In some cases, there's no easy to even
  determine what they might agree with.
| Your employer will only "deal with" problems that cause them real
  pain.  If you're butting heads, but still getting things done, then
  there's no real pain.  You're successful, even if you're unhappy.
| If you want to be both happy *and* successful, you need to stop doing
  things that make you unhappy.  If you can't agree with a co-worker,
  you can butt heads (which makes you unhappy) or you can ignore them
  (which may make you happy.)
| Ignoring them completely may mean that things will stop getting done.
   You may appear less successful.  If you stop being successful, then
  your employer will start to feel some pain.
| When you employer feels pain, they will take action to relieve the
  pain.
| You might want to try to provide clear, complete documentation of your
  colleague's ideas, whatever they are.  If you write down the
  Passive-Aggressive Programmer's "suggestions", then you might be able
  to demonstrate what's causing the pain.  Since a properly passive
  programmer never actually agrees with anything, it's tricky to pin
  them down to anything specific.
| You might be able to make it clear that they're the roadblock that
  needs to be removed.

If you feel that agreement is necessary just keep saying "I will take
your silence as tacit agreement to proceed". [silence implies consent]
Either Mr/Ms Passive-Aggressive will counter argue or give up and leave.
Still with 30 years experience under your belt I am surprised you have
ended up working alongside a PAP.
