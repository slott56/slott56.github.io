Read this on Gizmodo: "`How Yahoo Killed Flickr and Lost the
Internet <http://gizmodo.com/5910223/how-yahoo-killed-flickr-and-lost-the-internet>`__"
Compelling stuff: "Integration Is The Enemy of Innovation".
"[Corporate Development milestones] often completely ignore what made
the smaller target valuable in the first place."
Lessons learned: it's hard to apply structured, formal, financial
controls to innovation.  As soon as the accountants show up, innovation
will be stopped.  Someone has to champion the freedom to innovate in
spite of being part of a profit-seeking corporation.
