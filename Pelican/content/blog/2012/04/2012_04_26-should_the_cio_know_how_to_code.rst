The answer is "Yes."
The examples of "well-functioning non-technical CIOs" are people as rare
as hen's teeth.  "These are leaders who know what they don't know. They
are good at asking the right questions, probing for further insight, and
then re-framing the answers in such a way that the business side will
understand".
I'm sure there are people like this.  In the last 35 years, I've met
very, very few.  Two actually.
Larry and Chuck are the two examples.
Larry knew what he didn't know.  He took the time to actually sit with
actual developers and actually watch them work.  It was weird the first
time he sat and watched you type.  But without deep knowledge, he
couldn't be sure the projects would get done.  So he allocated an hour
or more each day to sit with key developers and learn.
Chuck did essentially the kind of thing.  He sat with each developer
individually every single day.  He did not have all-hands meetings that
lasted hours.  He did not have an "around the table" where everyone
spent 20 minutes boring the entire rest of the team with irrelevant
details.
Could they code?
Essentially, yes.  They looked at code over a developer's shoulder.
They participated in a form of "pair programming" where they watched
code happen.  By themselves they couldn't code much.  As pair
programmers, however, they could work with another programmer and get
stuff done.
