See http://madexpo.us/
The **Mid-Atlantic Developer Expo**.
In my backyard (more-or-less).
There's going to be this: http://madexpo.us/Sessions/384
and this: http://madexpo.us/Sessions/385
I'm looking forward to http://madexpo.us/Sessions/339, which I'm
certainly going to attend.  Many other sessions look like fun, too.
