Recently started looking into `Metadata
Registries <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata_registry>`__ and
UDEF and related semantic technology.

The Wikipedia page lists a bunch of relevant Metadata Registry
projects and commercial products.  Very nice.  Easy to follow the
links and determine features and benefits.

However.

A client has IBM Cognos.  Is there any easy to to see what kind of
Metadata features are part of Cognos?

No.  Not really.

I wondered about this marketing gap.  Why doesn't IBM (or Oracle,
they're pretty bad at this also) provide a tidy list of features?

-   They're so big (and arrogant) that they don't feel the need to do any
    marketing?

-   They're so paranoid that they don't want to have their products
    reduce to a simple bullet list?

-   They're sales people are so good that they don't need a web presence
    to sell their products?

-   They already have such tight wired-in relationships that they don't
    need to do any marketing?


Or is it the "growth by acquisition" problem?  Since IBM acquired
Cognos, they hesitate to commit to a list of features?


Whatever the reason, it's frankly difficult to include IBM products
in an easy-to-understand info-graphic comparing alternative products.

Perhaps that is their goal?
