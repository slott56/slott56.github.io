Just updated the `Stingray
Reader <https://sourceforge.net/projects/stingrayreader/>`__.  There was
an egregious error (and a missing test case).  I fixed the error, but
didn't add a test case to cover the problem.
It's simple laziness.  TDD is quite clear on how to tackle this kind of
thing.  Write the missing test case (which will now fail).  Then make
the code change.
But the code change was so simple.
