**Random Reminiscing Follows**

When I was in college (1974-1978) 64K of RAM was the size of a
refrigerator.

By 1982, 64K of RAM was an Apple ][+ fully tricked out with the 16K
expansion card.

I vaguely remember working with a "tower" device that was a 5MB disk
drive.  Think `Mac Pro <http://www.apple.com/macpro/>`__ case to hold a
disk drive.

By 1985 or so, 128K or RAM was a Macintosh and a 5MB disk drive a big
desktop console box.  Smaller than a tower.  Irritating because it took
up so much real-estate when compared with the Mac itself that was
designed to take up an 8 x 11 space (not including keyboard or mouse).
Now 5MB is round-off error.

**What's Important?**

Has computing gotten that much better?

Old folks (like me) reminisce about running large companies on small
computers.  Now, we can't even get our coffee in the morning without the
staggering capabilities of a 32GB iPhone.

Old folks, however, are sometimes mired in bad waterfall development
methods and don't understand the value of test-driven development.

While the hardware is amazing, the development tools and techniques
have improved, also.
