I've revised (and streamlined) my *Building Skills in Programming* book.
The 2.6.2. edition will simply replace the 2.6.1. edition, leading to
the possibility of broken bookmarks because of the changes.

Currently, the non-programmer book accounts for under 10% hits on the
http://www.itmaybeaback.com/book site.  Consequently, I'm not *very*
worried about the breakage.  I know someone will hate me for messing
with the content just as they were starting to understand it.

I'm indebted to all my readers for the numerous suggestions, corrections
and complements that I've received.  In order to simplify the correction
process, I've put the source onto SourceForge.  See the `Programming
Book-Python 2.6 <http://sourceforge.net/projects/progbook-py26/>`__
project.

The next step will be to add a PayPal donations button.

And... If I can get the PDF into really good shape, I may post it on
`Lulu <http://www.lulu.com/>`__ for folks who really want a hardcopy.

**Traffic**

For a random 2-day period, the usage looks like this:

246 distinct "users" (really IP addresses).

::

    {'html only': 161,
     ('both', 'oodesign-java-2.1'): 9,
     ('both', 'oodesign-python-2.1'): 5,
     ('both', 'programming-2.6'): 3,
     ('both', 'python-2.6'): 7,
     ('pdf only', 'oodesign-java-2.1'): 21,
     ('pdf only', 'oodesign-python-2.1'): 14,
     ('pdf only', 'programming-2.6'): 11,
     ('pdf only', 'python-2.6'): 37}

The "both" is a count of users reading HTML as well as the identified
PDF editions.

For the "html only" and "both" users, there's a detailed list of
particular books and sections.  Too large and boring to repeat here.

One interesting part is this detail:

::

    82.128.23.63 {'programming-2.6': 37, 'oodesign-java-2.1': 28, 'python-2.6': 37, 'oodesign-python-2.1': 24}

Apparently, Nigeria needs a **lot** of copies of the PDF.  I think I
might want to block them, because this can't be anything sensible except
endless polling by some botnet script.

Since we don't drop off cookies, we can't really identify user sessions.

Maybe in the future, I'll wrap the static content download with a
simple WSGI application to drop off and collect cookies to track users
instead of IP addresses.
