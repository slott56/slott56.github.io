Brilliant summary of what **really** motivates people.
The most important advice: provide a sense of purpose and get out of
people's way so that they can do the right thing.
Micromanagement, incentives, annual performance reviews and the like
aren't as useful as providing the sense of purpose, the opportunity for
mastery and the freedom of self-direction.
