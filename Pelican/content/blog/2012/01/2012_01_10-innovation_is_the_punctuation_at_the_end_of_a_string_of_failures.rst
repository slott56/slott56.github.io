Read this in Forbes: "`Innovation's Return on Failure:
ROF <http://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2011/05/05/innovations-return-on-failure-rof/>`__".

Also, this: "`The Necessity of Failure in Innovation (+ more on
CDOs) <http://blogs.hbr.org/berkun/2008/10/the-necessity-of-failure-in-in.html>`__".

This, too: "`Why innovation efforts
fail <http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2006/why-innovation-efforts-fail/>`__".

While we're at it: "`Accepting Failure is Key to Good Overall Returns on
High-Risk Development
Programs <http://commscopeblogs.com/2011/12/21/accepting-failure-is-key-to-good-overall-returns-on-high-risk-development-programs/>`__".

I can't say enough about the value of "failure".  The big issue here is
the label.

A project with a grand scope and strategic vision gets changed to make
it smaller and more focused.  Did it "fail" to deliver on the original
requirements?  Or did someone learn that the original grand scope was
wrong?

A project that changes isn't failure.  It's just lessons learned.

Canceling, re-scoping, de-scoping, and otherwise modifying a project is
what innovation looks like.  It should not be counted as a "failure".

A project "`Death
March <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_march_(project_management)>`__"
occurs because failure is not an option, and change will be labeled as
failure.

"Did it "fail" ... Or did someone learn ... "

Very few tribes (ooops, I think their called organizations these days)
would tolerate words like we are going to try ... and spend ... dollars
to figure out what to do. The response would be something like, what do
you mean that you don't know EXACTLY what to do?

Use the startup term "pivot". Startups don't fail. They try x, learn y
and then try z.
