    Startups piss people off because their existence is a statement that
    incumbents aren't doing their job well enough


Also true of IT internal innovation.  Pitch a novel, innovative idea
to management, and most organizations will find ways to avoid it.
Suggesting a bold new direction makes it look like someone isn't
doing their job.

If  you want to see real push-back, try suggesting that the incumbent
technology platform needs to be replaced.

As an example, consider an all-singing-all-dancing all VB shop.  The
idea that C# might be better is met with a variety of responses.

-   It's too costly to change now.  We can't afford the training or the
    licenses or something.  The list is long and often includes silly
    costs based on a really bad adoption strategy.  A bad adoption plan
    allows someone to defend their incumbent technology.

-   It's too risky to change now.  What risks?  The list of risks is
    often surprising and frustrating.  My favorite is the blanket "We
    don't know what we don't know" risk statement.  That's designed to be
    a complete show-stopper because there's no evidence to counter it.

-   The new Visual Studio has features that make VB acceptable for
    development.  It's so important to keep the legacy technology that
    excuses can be made and work-arounds applied to preserve it.


As another example, consider replacing a 30-year old COBOL system.
As part of stalling an innovative plan, I've been told that the only
scalable transaction-processing technology is COBOL-CICS-VSAM.  This
was about five years ago, when the incumbency of COBOL might have
seemed doubtful.  But to IT staff, the idea of Java was too
innovative.


The other problem was the innovative idea of a phased implementation.
Yes.  Agile thinking can be seen as disruptive to project managers;
it can appear that they don't add much value.  The idea that we'd
build "bridges" between legacy applications and new applications was
so unpleasant that we had to spend a long time discussing the
maintenance and support of throw-away code that existed just long
enough to be sure that all the *relevant* COBOL had been rewritten.


Bridges between old and new were portrayed as costly and risky.
These are the usual responses to a proposed new way of looking at
the problem.  And, of course, a phased implementation was inherently
low-value.  I've been told that a project was absolutely "all or
nothing" and no piece had value separate from the complete scope.


Suggesting a change means that there's a problem, right?  It means
their 30-year track record of COBOL support is less than perfect.  It
means their ability to use VB is flawed in some way.   The only
reason for a change is because -- somehow -- *they* have failed.
