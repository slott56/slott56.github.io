What's it all about?  `Code For America <http://codeforamerica.org/>`__.

Exploit the information we have to make civic improvements.  Ask any
journalist who wrestles with government data.  There's transparency
(i.e., lip service) and there's transparency.  Publishing information as
a PDF based on scans of paper documents doesn't really do much for folks
who are exercising their civic duty to analyze and correlate government
actions with social  benefits.

Only you can make your government more responsive.  Voting is one way.
Civic Hacking is another.

Another way is doing good data wrangling to expose the depth of
influence money has over politics.  Look at
`OpenSecrets.org <http://www.opensecrets.org/>`__ for an example.
