Read "`Why Software Patents are
Evil <http://www.infoworld.com/d/open-source-software/why-software-patents-are-evil-188738>`__"
by Simon Phipps in InfoWorld.
It's an excellent summary of the problems caused by patents applied to
software.
There's a great TED Talk by Johanna Blakley on "`Lessons Learned from
Fashion's Free
Culture <http://www.ted.com/talks/johanna_blakley_lessons_from_fashion_s_free_culture.html>`__"
which reinforces the essential point.
Software patents don't help anyone.  The open source movement is
evidence that folks working outside the constraints of patent lawyers
are more innovative and produce high-quality software.  The Internet is
built on non-proprietary technology (TCP/IP and related protocols),
GNU/Linux, Apache and similar software componentry.  How have patents
helped?
