As the #3 ranked contributor on http://programmers.stackexchange.com,
I've provided my share of advice.  554 Answers to be factual about it.
The moderators, however, have decided that I'm no longer welcome.  It
was simply shocking to be firmly (but politely) shown the door.

The issue was Python.  Specifically, the fact that Python uses
whitespace instead of C-style {}'s or some other notation for an
enclosed block of code.  The question -- closed by the moderators --
asked about convincing a reluctant boss to use Python instead of PHP for
web development.  The question stated that the boss liked his curly
braces.

My answer pointed out several things, two of which became issues.

Python doesn't use {}'s.  That means that {}'s aren't essential.  That
means the boss's preference for {}'s is a silly personal preference.

Generally, there's no way to convince someone to change their personal
preference.

According to a moderator, Python not using {}'s does not make {}'s
non-essential.  Even though Python does not use them, they're still --
somehow -- *essential*.  This means that the boss referenced in the
question is not expressing a personal preference. My claim that {}'s are
not essential is merely opinion, I'm being too aggressive in stating my
opinions, and Python's syntax is not a sufficient factual basis for my
claim that {}'s are not essential.

Wow.

Python doesn't use {}'s.  But I'm flat-out wrong to claim that liking
{}'s is a preference.

**Second**.  And weirder.  I claimed that people mess up punctuation
frequently, but they very rarely indent incorrectly.  I've spend hours
looking at C code that was indented nicely but omitted a closing }.

I've seen hundreds of Stack Overflow questions that amount to missing
punctuation.

The hundreds of Stack Overflow questions where punctuation was messed up
were deemed not factual.

Not factual?  Denied four separate ways.  Note that we're way beyond any
emotional response here.  I'm being told that my facts are not facts.
Denial One.  The moderator stated that they have never messed up
punctuation like {}'s.  While this may be true, it doesn't make other
people's problems fanciful.

Denial Two.  Those users were "dumb" for messing up punctuation.  While
this may also be true, it doesn't make other people's problems a matter
of my opinion.

Denial Three.  There are more questions with proper punctuation than
messed up punctuation.  This, too, my be true, but doesn't magically
make the other questions go away.  They still seem to exist as stubborn
irrefutable facts.  People mess up punctuation.  Perhaps they're dumb,
but they mess up.

Denial Four.  The moderator simply disputed the SO evidence.  I was
simply wrong to present it.

Wow again.

Other folks in the Programmers Chat said we we're not seeing
"eye-to-eye".  Wait, what?

A moderator says my responses about {}'s being non-essential and people
messing up {}'s were not *factual*.  I thought I provided *facts*.  The
moderator then simply refuted the facts saying that the facts were not
facts.  This is a purely emotional response preventing any rational
presentation of evidence.

I'm not sure that's an "eye-to-eye" issue.  That's more of a "I don't
like you" issue.

    ["You're just being a drama queen."  Okay.  I was told that I had a
    "history" of being "aggressive".  If my history is the basis for
    refuting the facts, that means this was merely personal.  As in "you're
    not welcome."]

The Moderator Problem is that there's no recourse.  I have the
third-highest reputation, but that carries no *actual* weight.  My
answer was edited in a shockingly heavy-handed way.  The question was
closed as "Not Constructive" presumably because the boss's understanding
of programming languages (e.g., {}'s are essential) is somehow "correct"
and hardly worth responding to.  And I was told that there's no reason
to argue with the moderators, I should just "move on".

    [I was also told to simply roll-back the edits and see what happens
    next.  That's being equally heavy-handed; a wikipedia edit war wouldn't
    address the "I deny your facts" problem.]

The design of the stack exchange sites allows flagging questions for
moderator attention.  This is pure genius.

But there's no way to flag *moderators* for further attention.  Perhaps
a "revote this answer" kind of process where the up voters and down
voters would be notified of a change to an answer.  But that seems
complex.  And if the original voters didn't feel like revoting after a
change, the results would be indeterminate.

It was suggested that I take the issue up on Programmer's Meta
(http://meta.programmers.stackexchange.com/).  I'm not sure what would
happen.  The question is closed.  The heavy-handed edits and refutation
of facts are invisible and therefore irrelevant.  All that's left is a
"don't see eye-to-eye" situation that no one needs to care about since
the question was closed.

It's hard to get over such a blatant refutation of stubborn facts.

It's hard to get over a moderator simply refusing to *moderate* but
instead taking the time to repeatedly refute simple facts.

Curly braces essential? How about all the languages that don't use
braces? Like Fortran, Pascal, Lisp, Forth, Ada, Erlang, and who knows
how many more. It would be easier to argue that statement terminators
(semicolons, etc.) may be essential, but braces?

While you certainly have the right to express your opinion here Mr.
Lott, it would help an awful lot to link to the question in question -
for people not so familiar with the SO knowledge cycle.
That said, I always feel that a message consist of 50% content and 50%
presentation. For example the sentence "False assumption." has the
content "I think this is a false assumption" for you. I believe, you try
to cut the 'obvious'. Others might read the 'obvious' as "I know that
better than you". It is your personal opinion - your presentation should
reflect this clearly imho or the message becomes unclear: "I feel this
is a wrong assumption." I think you want to be effective - but you
cannot be effective with people (See the 7 habits book).
The comment of Wassim suggests to me that people could have taken
offense in your presentation which could have lead to a swing of
emotions which could have led to this no-win situation here. Wassim
seems to have taken a commendable approach to this and changed
(bettered!) himself which is really the only thing one can do as one
can't change others. I would suggest you take an example in him as he
did in you and think about 'bettering' your presentation. I do not put
the blame on you (or the moderator for that matter) - but you cannot
change the moderator, only yourself.
I really hope we do not loose your knowledge and your love of sharing
it. It would be a loss for the python community.

Sad to read this and the train wreck SE chat, but the most damning part
is how much latitude the moderators have to put words in your mouth.
Each answer has the look and feel like it's "from me", but if moderators
are encouraged to replace what I say with what they prefer I had said,
I'll have to rethink my participation in Stack Exchange before
aggressive editors start making me sound just like Wikipedia. The
"edited" link isn't enough to signal that "my words" may in fact be
someone else's.

I read through the chat transcripts that resulted from the question, er,
in question and...well, just wow. All I can think of to say is that
StackExchange is losing a huge asset if they force you out. Your handle
is very familiar to me, a frequent peruser of [python]. When there is an
exceptionally detailed and helpful Python-related answer it very
frequently comes from one of a small list of people...and you are one of
those people. All I can say is that if you start spending less time on
StackExchange it just means you have more time to spend helping in other
knowledge-circles.

If curly braces are essential and indentation is a matter of opinion,
then why is indentation style considered a key issue in coding styles
for curly brace languages?
But I understand; I grew up in the curly brace world. Significant
whitespace was downright scary to me at first, too. I overcame my fear
and so will they. It's just a shame they've chased away a valuable asset
in the interim.

I'm sorry, but I seem to be reading the actual exchange differently.
Your original comment (in the question history) was "The extra curly
braces aren't really all that helpful." Which is not the same as "{}'s
aren't essential."[?]
If your statement was "{}s are not essential in a language" it makes
sense (and is fact). "The extra curly braces aren't really all that
helpful" on the other hand, is an opinion because there is no way to
determine whether it is true or not - what is "really", or "helpful"?

This shut down is indeed quite unfair, but you had it coming.
You do have an history of being agressive, on SO at least.
I do find your answers interesting, I even got your blog in my RSS
feeds.
But man, if you don't learn to say interesting things in a more
diplomatic way, you'll get people cumulating bad feelings about you, and
they will strike back one day (like this one), whatever the reason, just
because they can.
You can ignore this advice (which, again, comes from somebody that
actually likes to read you), but if you do so, just stop complaining
about the consequences.

Ok. It's about some months now since I've decided to quit SO for a
while. You, Mr. Lott, you were the reason. In what way? Well, without
entering to the boring details let's just say that you're "HARD" with
not-so-academic-formatted-brains. I'm one of them.
BUT, your attitude made me think about why this man with worth-gold rep
is hard with me? After some extra thoughts I realized that the man with
the big rep (you Mr. Lott) is just PRECISE, and apparently I'm one of
those who don't dare to face precision. After taking a look at your
worth-being-classics books, I finally realized that I need to
re-introduce myself with computer science, the science of DETAILS.
Now, I'm enrolled in a computer science class, I'm reading math books,
I'm trying to be precise in my thoughts, and I'm somehow ashamed of
posting those kind of questions, but it seems that it was worth it. I'm
really thankful to you Mr. Lott.
BTW, I'm changed to a point where I'm starting to think that Alex
Martellis answers are too long, he needs to be more PRECISE ;-)

I'm sure it was your tone that was the problem -- how you said it rather
than what you said. While I don't use Programmers, your SO answers (and
comments) are often dripping with an intolerable (to me) superior
attitude.
I'm not sure moderator action is warranted, but I can understand wanting
to remove you from the conversation, as I often feel you are a net
negative whatever your level of technical knowledge or correctness.

discriminating against you ;-)

wait... they kicked you off SO? that's insane given your contribution.
That being said, I echo the feelings of e-satis and sirver
if your goal is to teach people you need to do more then provide a
sufficient answer. Maybe pick up a book on teaching like Ignite (geared
towards teaching younger children).
In short, people need to feel comfortable in order to learn. If they
feel mocked,afraid,outclassed or any anything other then excited and
safe they will recoil. Enough recoil and they will revolt even if your
answer is correct.
