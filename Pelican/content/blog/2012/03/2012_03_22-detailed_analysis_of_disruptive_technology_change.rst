| Don't be afraid to read it again.

   when it comes to the exceptional cases, all bets are off. So keep
   your mind open to weird, young [ideas] that you meet that donâ€™t fit
   the established pattern

| Sound advice.  The best ideas are disruptive.  That means that the
  idea does not fit an established pattern.
| The problem with being an architect is that software architecture is a
  political game.
| In order to justify large projects with large funding, you must cater
  to the folks with money who (generally) feel that disruption == risk.
   The idea of incremental effort and proofs of concept may not fly
  because they've decided that inappropriate incumbent technology is
  magically quicker than appropriate but novel technology.
| There's a profound Software Process Improvement issue here.
   Organizations can (and do) stifle innovation in an effort to
  "improve" their software development process.  The false hope is that
  an unchanging technology base is somehow helpful at making people more
  effective.
| Even if you give people second-rate tools, you can eventually get to
  be pretty good at using them.  However.  Using better tools might be
  better than trying to get really good at using poor tools.
| What I find endlessly funny are folks who want "formal research" or
  "studies" that prove that some new idea is actually better than
  existing ideas.  You can read Stack Overflow and
  programmers.stackexhcange.com questions looking for studies that
  *prove* the value of unit testing or *prove* the value of a NoSQL
  database or *prove* that software is simpler without triggers or
  stored procedures.
| For the moment, these are disruptive ideas.
| We know they're disruptive because people keep asking for proof.
| When they stop asking for proof, you know the idea has finally
  "arrived" and it's time to move on to find the edge of the envelope
  again.
