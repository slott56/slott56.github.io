A random list of cool things.

#.  HTML5.  Start now.  It's supported (more or less) by all browsers if
    you add appropriate shims.  Start with sites
    like http://www.html5rocks.com/en/ and continue reading.  It's
    largely arrived and there's no compelling reason to delay.

#.  JavaScript.  I'm not a fan of the language.  However.  It's clearly
    here to stay. It's part of many important technologies (like
    CouchDB).  HTML5 shims (or
    `shivs <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_Shiv>`__) are necessary.
    Flex (and other browser plug-in languages) are effectively dead.
    JavaScript is all that's left.

#.  `Redis <http://redis.io/>`__.  Wow! Is that cool?  Rather that fart
    around trying to get outstanding performance out of a clunky old
    RDBMS, use a simple, high performance data store.

#.  `MongoDB <http://www.mongodb.org/>`__.  Now that I've seen it, I have
    a vague notion of places where Mongo is better and places where Couch
    might be better.  In 80% of the application space, both are fine.
    But there's a 20% where we might be able to split a hair and
    leverage the slightly different feature sets.


I don't build mobile apps.  But if I did, I think I'd start with
`Appcelerator Titanium <http://www.appcelerator.com/platform>`__
before switching to a "native" development environment.  The idea that
several standard features are readily accessible with a convenient
development environment is pleasant.

I finally laid eyes on an `Arduino <http://www.arduino.cc/>`__.  Let
me simply say that it looks like dangerous, dangerous fun.  I think
I'll be hanging around at `Radio
Shack <http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12268262>`__
a lot.
