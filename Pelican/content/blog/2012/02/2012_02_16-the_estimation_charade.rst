"In reality, most projects worth doing are not repetitions of
previous things."



Thank you for that.



If it has been done before -- same problem -- same technology -- then
we should be able to clone that solution and avoid creating a
software development project.  If there's something novel -- new
problem -- new technology -- then we can't easily predict the whole
sweep of software development effort.



The whole Estimation Charade is an artifact of the way accountants
exercise control over the finances.  They require (with the force of
law) that budgets be written in advance.  Often in advance of the
requirements being known.  When we sit down to fabricate next year's
budget, we're dooming some fraction next year's projects to a
scramble for funding leading to cancellation and failure.



Accountants further require that software development be arbitrarily
partitioned into "capital" and "expense".  There's no rational
distinction between the phases.  The nature and scope of the work
don't change at all.



Yet.



Somehow, the accountants are happy because some capital budget has
been spent (as planned 18 months ago) and now we're spending expense
budget.  From an accounting perspective, some kind of capital asset
has been created.



Think of it.  Some lines of code are a capital asset.  Other lines of
code are an expense.



Someday, I'll have to ask some accountants to explain how I can tell
which was which.

A few thoughts on this (as a finance manager and beginning programmer
who has read your online books).

1) If your issue is that the accountants can't even explain the
difference between what is capitalized and what is expensed, you have
bad accountants and you should read the standards yourself. They're not
that long.

If the software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, FASB topic
985.20.25 answers your question.

If the software is internal use, FASB 340.40.25 has your answer.

2) Assuming #1 isn't your issue, it might be that you find the phased
process outlined in 340.40.25 and 985.20.25 to be far more reflective of
a waterfall methodology than the more Agile methods you use.

If so, here's a pitch that talks about how to apply existing accounting
rules to Agile methodologies:
http://www.scribd.com/doc/40154541/Agile-Accounting

There is always considerably leeway in the determination of accounting
phases. Perhaps you can show this pitch to your accountants to get them
to see that they can interpret the phases in a way that is more
consistent with Agile methodologies.

3) "Some lines of code are a capital asset. Other lines of code are an
expense." Yes, we know. If it makes you feel any better, it doesn't make
sense to us, either, and there are dozens of other accounting areas that
are equally arbitrary.

Good finance managers know that the only thing that matters is cash flow
and the "market value" of the software you build (vs. the accounting
charges and resultant assets). They also know that there are better uses
of developer's time than supporting accounting processes which, quite
frankly, has no impact on a company's value.

If the finance people you have in charge of your business don't see it
that way, they're just not good at what they do.
