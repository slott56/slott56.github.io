For a training class, I needed to address The Windows Problemâ„¢. TWP is
the my summary of all the non-standard features of Windows in its
various inconsistent incarnations.

Any training class that involves "install Python" inevitably involves at
least one Windows user who can't get their PATH set correctly. It's an
eternal mystery to me, since the installers all seem to take care of
this, but, some people are able to click the wrong thing somewhere in a
simple installation.

The uninstall and start again sometimes helps. Having a Windows expert
in the room sometimes helps.

(The hapless flailing I sometimes observe is my personal problem to deal
with. I should not let myself get short-tempered with people who try
things exactly once and then stop, unable to discern a single branch in
the path they chose. It's as if the sequence of dialog boxes with
different choices never existed for them, and I need to respect the fact
that they did not read the messages and did not think of themselves as
actively making choices.)

I have to say that being able to get a Windows machine in free tier of
AWS is a wonderful resource.

**I can screen capture the installation on Windows.**

I can narrate the sequence of choices I made. I'm hoping this prevents
TWP from side-tracking a person who's struggling with Windows.
I haven't used the movies yet. But it's so handy to be able to spin up a
Windows machine in the cloud and run the Conda install. It's a whole lot
nicer than buying a throw-away Windows machine to do screen shots on.

Howdy just wanted to give you a quick heads up. The words in your post
seem to be running off the screen in Opera. I'm not sure if this is a
formatting issue or something to do with internet browser compatibility
but I figured I'd post to let you know. The design look great though!
Hope you get the problem solved soon. Kudos
