For the last 3 years, I've been doing a weekly webinar on Python -- at
work. I've done about a 100 of them, and they've had a pretty good
response.
Each one was live and I didn't try to record them. There's enough going
on without fooling around with Zoom meeting recordings and saving them
somewhere. The first few were pretty haphazard affairs.
Someone who's a regular consumer of podcasts told me mine were actually
good.
Not "you're a friend, so I'll say it's not horrible," but "really good."
And "better than most." And "engaging, considering the boringness of
your topic."
At first, I found this surprising, but I was benchmarking myself against
NPR journalists -- people who are the best in the world. Compared
against stuff readily available online, however, it appears I may be OK.
Sometime in the next few months or so, I may start trying my hand at
recording some things and posting them.
I'll have to get my tech stack together, produce a few, and then figure
out how others are distributing them. Much to learn.
