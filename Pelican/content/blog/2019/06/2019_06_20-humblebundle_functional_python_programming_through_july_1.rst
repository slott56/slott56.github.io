This is amazing to me.


      Humble Bundle sells games, ebooks, software, and other digital
      content. Our mission is to support charity while providing awesome
      content to customers at great prices. We launched in 2010 with a
      single two-week Humble Indie Bundle, but we have humbly grown into
      a store full of games and bundles, a subscription service, a game
      publisher, and more.


Currently, Packt is offering some of my books.
