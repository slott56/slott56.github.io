üì∫üêç Cool New Features in Python 3.8 `realpython.com/courses/cool-n‚Ä¶ <https://t.co/1sv8l2Vgyr>`__


The `Cool New Features in Python
3.8 <https://realpython.com/courses/cool-new-features-python-38/>`__ lists
some of the things that could become part of The Modern Python
Cookbook 2e. I'm working with Packt on a plan for creating a new
edition focused on Python 3.8 features, and using **mypy** to
validate the type hints.


I'm learning a lot about my previously sketchy designs and potential
problems with some of them. There are a number of things in Python
which "work" in a vague hand-wavey way. But they don't work in a "I
can convince mypy this will work" way.


The additional "convince mypy" rigor can separate potentially sketchy
design from an unassailable design.
