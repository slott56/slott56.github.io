While eloquent and thorough, I remain unconvinced that this is a
significant improvement over try/except.
It's common enough in some functional languages to have strong support
and a long, successful history.
I think it replaces one problem with another. It's not a "solution".
It's an alternative. Instead of exceptions being raised, they're
returned. Cool.
