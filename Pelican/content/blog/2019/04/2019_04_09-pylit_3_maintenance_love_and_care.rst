The PyLit tool dates from 2009. Here's a historical
reference: http://wiki.c2.com/?PyLit
It was Python 2. It had some minor problems. I forked it and cleaned it
up for Python 3.
Then I set it aside for a few years (six or so.)
Dusting it off. Rearranging things. The legacy Python 2 version -- it
appears -- is gone forever.
The current thing available in PyPI doesn't even download and install on
a modern Python because the metadata makes it look like it won't be
compatible with a Python 3.7 world. So. That needs to be fixed. And
while I'm at it...
- Add tox support for Python 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 properly.
- Restructure the docs to use Github Pages from master/docs.
- Get the download squared away so pip install will work.
- Use pathlib.
- Start down the road toward type hinting. Which will likely exclude
py35 support.
I may, as part of type hinting, be forced to make some more changes to
the essential structure of the app(s).
For now, I simply need to get it to be pip installable.
