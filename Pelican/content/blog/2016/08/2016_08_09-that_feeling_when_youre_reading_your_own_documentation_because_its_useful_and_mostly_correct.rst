I'm looking at code (as a man does) and I can't remember if there's a
class that does X. There's a lot of code. I wrote almost all of it. And
-- maybe it's the gin -- but I just can't recall if there's an X. It
seems like there should be.
Scan. Scan. Scroll. Scroll.
Read. Read.
Wait!
I have a pretty good gh-pages branch for this. Sphinx-based. Mostly
up-to-date. Let's look there.
Ahhh. So much nicer than scrolling through code. Indexes work.
This whole "documentation" thing is pretty cool. Now I'm actually happy
that other people guilted me into doing it.
