Fascinating.
A world of interconnected devices in which we place a kind of implicit
trust. There's little visibility for ordinary consumers. It takes a
skilled specialist to determine that there are flaws in a product.
It's not that the system is "flaky."
It's that this combination of components each with unexpected edge-case
behavior is actually broken.
