What is the point? Seriously. What. The. Actual. Heck?

I think of it this way.

-   Languages are a cool thing. Especially programming languages where
    there's an absolute test -- the Turing machine -- for completeness.

-   The Forth-like stack language is a cool thing. I've always liked
    Forth because if it's elegant simplicity.

-   The use of a first-class lambda construct to implement if and while
    is particularly elegant.

-   Small languages are fun because they can be understood completely.
    There are no tricky edge cases in the semantics.


I have Â½ of a working GW-Basic implementation in Python, too. It
runs. It runs some programs like HamCalc sort of okay-ish. I use it
to validate assumptions about the legacy code
in https://github.com/slott56/HamCalc-2.1.  Some day, I may make a
sincere effort to get it working.


Even languages like the one that supports the classic Adventure game
are part of this small language fascination.
See `adventure.pdf <http://www.literateprogramming.com/adventure.pdf>`__ for
a detailed analysis of this game; this includes the little language
you use to interact with the game.
