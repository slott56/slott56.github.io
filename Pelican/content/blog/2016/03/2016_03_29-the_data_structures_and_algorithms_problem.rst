Here's a snippet of an email

    In big data / data science, the curse of dimensionality keeps showing
    up over and over. A good place to start is the wiki article “\ `curse
    of
    dimensionality <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality>`__.”
    The issue seems to be that a lot of these big data / data science
    people have not taken the time to study fundamental data structures.


There was more about `Foundations of Multidimensional and Metric Data
Structures <http://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Multidimensional-Structures-Kaufmann-Computer/dp/0123694469>`__
by Hanan Samet being too detailed. And Stack Overflow being too
high-level.  And more hand-wringing after that, too.

The email was pleading for some book or series of blog posts that
would somehow educate data science folks on more fundamental issues of
data structures and algorithms. Perhaps getting them to drop some
dimensions when doing k-NN problems or perhaps exploit some other data
structure that didn't involve 100's of columns.

I think.

I'm guessing because -- like a lot of hand-waving emails -- it didn't
involve code. And yes, I'm very bigoted about the distinction between
code and hand-waving.

If there is a lack of awareness of appropriate data structures, the
real place to start is `The Algorithm Design
Manual <http://www.algorist.com/>`__ by Steven Skiena.

I harbor my doubts that this is the real problem, however. I think
that the broad spectrum of computing applications leads to a lot of
specialization. I don't think that it's really prudent to try and
think of generalists who can handle deep data science issues as well
as algorithm design and performance issues. No one expects them to
write JavaScript and tinker with CSS so that the web site which
presents the results looks good.

I actually think the real problem is that some folks expect too much
from their data scientists.

In fantasy land the rock stars are full stack developers who can span
the entire spectrum from OS to CSS. In the real world, developers have
different strengths and interests. In some cases, "full stack" means
mediocre skills in a lot of areas.

Here's a more useful response: `Bridging the Gap Between Data Science
and
DevOps <https://medium.com/packt-publishing/bridging-the-gap-between-data-science-and-devops-93285ca07cf0#.68q5nf3za>`__.
I don't think the problem is "big data / data science people have not
taken the time to study fundamental data structures". I think the
problem is that big data is a cooperative venture. It takes a team to
solve a problem.
