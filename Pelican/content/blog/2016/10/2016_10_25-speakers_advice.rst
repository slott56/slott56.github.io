First. Read this: http://webapplog.com/10-conf-donts/

Some additional thoughts on the don't list.

#. **Avoid** reading to your audience unless you are a poet, journalist,
   judge or politician. Poets and journalists are paid to write well and
   read there words well. Judges and politicians are paid to be ultra
   precise.

#. **Avoid** Type and Talk unless it is a Code Dojo presentation where
   the typing is essential. I've seen too many bad type-and-talk where
   the lack of organization made it nearly impossible to figure out what
   was going on.

#. **Avoid** GIFs and clever graphics.

#. **Avoid** insulting people. Don't alienate your audience. If you
   can't be completely 100% inclusive of every single human being in the
   room, don't speak in public.

#. **Avoid** sitting if you are able to stand. If you must sit, please
   try to sit where folks can see you. This can't **always** work.
   Someone able to stand who chooses to sit is doing themselves a
   disservice. A singer or vocal coach will tell you that your standing
   posture helps you breathe properly and project properly. If you are
   able to stand, please stand.

#. **Avoid** nervous behaviors. **Avoid** drawing attention to yourself,
   and draw attention to your material  Fear (or nervousness) is hard to
   avoid. It's important to focus on the audience and their curiosity
   about your talk. They were intrigued by the title. They want to hear
   you.

#. **Avoid** apologies. Apologize if you offend someone, of course. But
   don't "pre-apologize" for some irrelevant aspect of your
   presentation. Your audience came for the content, not for apologies.

#. **Avoid** too much sales pitch. I've sat through too many product
   demos that had a half-hour sales pitch that left only a half-hour for
   the actual useful information. This has happened even when I told
   vendors -- explicitly -- not to provide any sales information during
   the product demo.

#. **Avoid** too much personal background. A complete recitation of your
   CV isn't interesting and brushes up against an Argument from
   Authority fallacy.

#. **Avoid** dressing badly.

A list of things to **do**.

#.  Speak with passion about your topic. Your slides are your road-map
    through the agenda. A few key points and reminders are all you
    should have.

#.  Speak to the people listening. Canned code examples are good, if
    they emphasize your point. Copy and paste into an IDE if you are
    demonstrating the IDE.

#.  Focus on the material, not other irrelevant cleverness.

#.  Focus on the audience as people interested in your topic.

#.  To project your voice -- and your presence -- you need to be
    visible. Stand if you can. Try to be as visible as possible.

#.  Focus on your audience's need to hear your material. It's not
    about you, it's about your content.

#.  Focus on the good, useful, informative information you're
    providing.

#.  Present outstanding content first. Sales are merely a hoped-for
    consequence of a good presentation.

#.  Your content should stand on it's own. You only need a brief
    summary of your qualifications.

#.  Project your presence. Dress so that you can be seen without being
    distracting.
