I've seen companies making sincere enterprise-wide commitments to doing
all data analysis in Python. There's no reason for quants and analysts
to struggle with Java.
I field one or two questions a week from folks pushing the in-house
envelope on data acquisition.
I also field questions on language basics.
It's a very exciting thing.
I'm glad I started down this road 15 years ago.
