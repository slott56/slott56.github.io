I know it sounds arrogant, but I don't want to share your screen to sort
out a Python programming problem. I have two reasons and I think one of
them is a good one.


It's both pedagogical and personal.


Personally, I'm often left breathless by demos. Watching the cursor
fly around the screen is -- well -- dizzying. What was I supposed to
be watching? Who's IM messages are popping up? What meeting reminders
are you ignoring?

It may seem helpful to wave the cursor around, and show me your whole
desktop world. And for some people, the discussion may actually be
helpful. Sometimes they have an epiphany while they're explaining
stuff to me. That's good. For me, it's bewildering. Sorry. I'm only
going to read the visible fragments of your emails in the background
window.

From a pedagogical perspective, there's this point:

    **I think that it's very important to learn how to focus on the details that matter.**

This breaks down into several related skills:

#.  I think everyone needs to be able to copy and paste text.
    Screenshot images are hard to work with. On Stack Overflow, a
    4-space indent is mandatory. It's not hard. A surprising number of
    programmers struggle with it.

#.  Articulate the actual problem. "Doesn't work" really is not
    sensible. I think it's important to insist on a concrete statement
    of the problem. Asking me to deduce it while looking at your
    screen isn't building any of your skills.

#.  Find the relevant portion of the Python traceback. Yes, that's
    hard. But it's part of coding. Asking me to read the traceback
    doesn't build your skills.

#.  Find the relevant portions of the code that's broken. Again, when
    I pinpoint the line of code from reading the traceback, your
    skills haven't grown. I'm well aware that it's confusing when
    there's a long traceback from a framework that only seems to
    include your module 6 levels in. If you aspire to mastering code,
    that has to be part of your aspiration.

#.  Hypothesize a root cause. This is perhaps the hardest skill. The
    confirmation bias problem leads many people to write wrong code
    and complain that it's "broken" in a vague way. During screen
    sharing they scroll past their assumptions as if they're always
    correct. I have sympathy. But, it's essential to understand the
    semantics of alanguage. More importantly, it's essential to learn
    to judge where our assumptions might deviate from reality.
    Overcoming confirmation bias is hard. Maybe a long conversation is
    the only way to realize this; I hope not.

#.  Experiment. Python offers the >>> prompt at which you can
    experiment. Use it. This is the best way to explore your
    assumptions and see what the actual language semantics are.


Maybe I'm just being hypersensitive, but there's little to really
talk about. If we could focus on the relevant code, perhaps
through copy-and-paste, I can help. Otherwise, I feel like I'm
just watching helplessly while an amusement park ride spins me
around for a while, leaving me dizzy and confused. And not having
offered any concrete help.
