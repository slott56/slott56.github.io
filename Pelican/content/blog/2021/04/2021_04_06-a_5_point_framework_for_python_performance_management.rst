See `A 5-Point Framework For Python Performance
Management <https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/a-5-point-framework-for-python-performance-management-5af2be5739d9>`__.

It seems straight-forward to me. Have goals. Measure your ability to
meet them.

I don't see too many teams doing this, though.

I could be wrong, but, I think performance is left to arguments and
complaints, not solid engineering.
