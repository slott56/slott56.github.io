I get asked about good books for beginners. Here's an example:

   "What Python books do you recommend for novices so they can learn
   from beginner to advanced?"

For me, this is nearly impossible to answer.

"Beginner" is often undefined. I have to turn this around and ask what
you already know about -- well-- everything. Computing. Programming.
Languages. etc. etc.

"Advanced" similarly is undefined. Most folks have areas they're
interested in. Machine Learning. IoT. Security. Cloud Engineering.
Graphics. Games. Sound. etc. et yet even more ceteras.

And -- even more fascinating to me -- where are you on that journey?
What have you done so far?

I'm am (overly) sensitive to being a Personal Search Concierge, PSCâ„¢.

I know people who (actually) cannot make Google work. Seriously. Utterly
unable to use it. I believe that they are incapable of reframing their
question with synonyms, but instead insist on typing a single thing into
the search bar, and if the first promoted response in the list of
advertisements doesn't literally answer their question, they email me.

This leads me to a stammering stupidity when asked about Python books.

Yes, I'm an author. Yes, I read other books. But no, I don't think I can
answer your question.

What does "advanced" mean?
--------------------------

Most of the Python experts I know are experts at applying Python to a
problem domain. In rare cases, the problem domain is Python itself, but
even then, the focus often narrows to a specific package in the standard
library, or an aspect of the run-time.

In the process of solving problems with Python, most people tend to
learn a fair amount of the language. I work with folks who are fabulous
problem-solvers but who'll sometimes be surprised by a Python feature
that's outside their already broad experience.

What's central here is that they're apply Python **to** something. The
thing that seems to distinguish novices from experts is the pursuit of a
solution to a problem, and learning Python as part of solving the
problem.

It's essential, then, to have a problem about which one is passionate.
Given a problem, and passion to solve that problem, expertise will grow.

So that's my other possible non-answer: find a problem you're passionate
about and apply Python to solving it.

And yes, that's not a book. Books can help with understanding the
problem or working out a solution in Python. Rarely does one book do
both.

A good friend of mine's Python expertise comes from arranging the
metadata in thousands of photographs on his computer. Apple's photos app
has gone through numerous changes, and his photo library had become a
jumble of obsolete folders, no longer supported by the current app. So
they mastered Python and Apple's scripting tools, and Photos, and Mac OS
X to arrange their photos.

There are many Civic Tech organizations like the `Code for
America <https://www.codeforamerica.org/events/brigade-congress-2020>`__
where you can confront large, complex problems, and build tech skills
while helping solve a real-world problem.

Everyone's journey is unique.
