The Python Programming language is a deep topic. This book provides
focused guidance on installing Python, creating virtual enivironments
and using Jupyter Lab to build foundational skills in using Python. The
book covers many built-in data types. There are two small case studies
and one larger case study to provide examples of how Python can be used
to tackle real-world problems. There are over 100 code samples.

The companion GitHub repository,
https://github.com/slott56/pivot-to-python, contains all of the example
code.
