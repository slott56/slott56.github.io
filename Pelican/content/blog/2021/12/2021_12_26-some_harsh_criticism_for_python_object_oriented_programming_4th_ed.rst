These are reviews of `Python Object-Oriented Programming: Build robust
and maintainable object-oriented Python applications and libraries, 4th
Edition <https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/programming/9781801077262/2>`__.

All reviews are helpful, even ones that are critical. We're constantly
striving to improve this content. Also, we're aware we can't please
everyone. I like reviews with clearly-stated points. The one-star review
had three important points.

First. "There are enough typed and strongly typed languages in the
world". I don't think this is something I can address in a book about
Python. `PEP 484 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/>`__ dates
from 2014. Back then, this opinion may have been more influential. As it
is, the comment is perhaps too late to be useful. The annotations are a
feature of the language, and it seems important to include them in a
book about the language.

Perhaps, the criticism isn't about the Python language. Perhaps this is
really a criticism of presenting type annotations as a central part of
the book. The comment seems to be about the language more than the
book.

Second. "...the k-NN example seems too incongruous..." and "... it was
more of an hindrance..." This is interesting. The book covers the k-NN
algorithm from a variety of perspectives. The intent was to provide
multiple partial solutions, each illustrating only techniques shown in a
given chapter. I can see how this might be confusing, and perhaps the
examples need to be refactored to reduce overlap between them.

Or. Perhaps k-NN is too simple. Or. It might be that k-NN is already
solved in a number of packages like scikit learn. It seemed like a
algorithm with a moderate level of complexity and direct application to
analytics and data science.

Third, "The English is not always good ... the book could have done with
a bit more proofreading." I'd love some concrete examples. I suspect the
problem is my Americanisms have caused problems for non-American
readers. Perhaps I didn't try hard enough to match Dusty's
conversational tone in the 3rd edition. Examples would help to point out
where language problems were introduced.

The three-star review had a misleading statement, "This edition also
uses non-standard python syntax on definitions functions etc". The type
hints have been part of the language since PEP 484, and it seems
inappropriate to describe them as non-standard.
