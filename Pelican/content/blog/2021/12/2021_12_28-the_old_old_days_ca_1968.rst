As the olds do, I reminisce sometimes. Not often. Let me rewind the
memory tapes a back to 1967 or '68.

(What a dumb metaphor for folks who have never used serial storage.)

This isn't -- directly -- about Python. But it may help folks who live
at the edge of programming find a project that motivates them to learn
to code.

This was my first exposure to an actual computer. I think it was an old
`IBM 650 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_650>`__ that our high-school
had. I wasn't in high school yet, but there was an open house, and they
fired this thing up.

What was the demo program?

The thing was running a version of blackjack.

It would clatter and type something like

::

    J S
    9 C  7 D
   >

And wait for your input. The first line was the dealer's card and your
two cards. You could then enter your plan -- hit, stand, split, or
double. Subsequent lines would play out your hand.

And yes, I recall much of the interaction to this day. (Not all the
details. It was a long time ago.)

This shaped my understanding of "computing as simulation."

It also caused me to become interested in random numbers and the idea of
generating pseudo-random numbers with digital computers. I'll be posting
some more thoughts on random numbers and -- I promise -- there will be
Python code.
