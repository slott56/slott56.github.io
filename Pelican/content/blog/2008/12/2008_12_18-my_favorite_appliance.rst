December 11th, the electric power went out here in the northeast, and stayed out until late on the 14th.  



We have gas heat, gas cooking.  But the furnace wouldn't run without AC power.  So, I now have a favorite electrical appliance -- the blower on my furnace.:Apple-tab-span:`` 



Here's my strategy.



1.  A furnace transfer switch.  See this http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=Furnace+Transfer+Switch.



2.  A small (1.7Kw) generator.  See this http://www.google.com/search?q=1700+w+generator.



3.  An extension cord that goes well out into the backyard.  Folks died around here from `CO poisoning <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide_poisoning>`_ .



It takes some discipline, but I think one can manage with a tiny, thrifty generator.



-   Put the food in a cooler and move it from fridge to porch when the porch is colder.

-   Run the furnace as necessary.

-   Unplug the furnace, plug in the sump pump as needed.



Like all good software, I think it's just enough.  The fully automated transfer switches and full-powered generators seem more complex than necessary.



Lighting?  I have flashlights and lanterns, and a Weems and Plath Oil Yacht Lamp.  Internet?  Panera, Starbucks, and others offer WiFi.  What else is there?
