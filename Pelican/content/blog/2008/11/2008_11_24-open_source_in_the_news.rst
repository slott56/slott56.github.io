The `Open Source Enterprise <http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/open_source/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=212002355&subSection=Open+Source>`_  article in the November 15th InformationWeek is quite cool.  Here's the "wow" quote for me.

    Another way that open source code meets current needs is through lighter-weight integration than commercial vendors typically offer. By definition, open source code adheres to publicly approved standards. That means open source developers and vendors are ready to compete in a software market that's increasingly relying on Web standards.





The standards issue is interesting.  Open Source software is more standards-compliant than the proprietary source world.
