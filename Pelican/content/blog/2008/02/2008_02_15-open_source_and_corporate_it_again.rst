Someone sent this question to their manager and included me on the CC: list.


    "Would you consider tools like Django to quickly build web apps ?"


My suggestion is that a bald query like this can only get on of two possible answers: "No" (and a large number of unsubtle variations like "hell no") and the ego-salving "If it makes business sense, we'll consider it."  Which is code for "no".





The "No" card is easy to play.  The manager simply trumps it with the "risk" card and the hand is over.  Manager wins by saying "open source" == "risk" enough times that everyone up down the food chain can repeat the unsubstantiated claim.





The "If it makes business sense" card is equally easy.  The burden of proof is delightfully vague and the resulting action ("consider it") allows an easy toss of the "No" card.  Neither requires thought or any action other than the "prevent change" defense.





Permission vs. Forgiveness
--------------------------





In short, asking permission gets you nowhere.  I said as much.  I got this reply.





"I planted the seed via the email and lets see what happens."





Sorry, but, here's what will happen:  Nothing.  You have to actually **Do**  something.  About the only thing that will turns heads is to build a proof-of-concept.  And you'll *never*  get permission to do that; you have to do it surreptitiously.  Once you've actually done something, the horse is out of the barn.  The bell cannot be un-rung.  Now the relationship is one of damage control and forgiveness -- battles where there is no clear Maginot line.





It doesn't matter how good new technology is, it takes an epic problem to lead IT to consider changing course and actually taking action on those considerations.  The email didn't characterize or reflect any  company-threatening problem.  It didn't reflect any problem at all except the usually boo-hooing of software development being slow and expensive.





Course Corrections
--------------------





I don't see how a "you should change course" suggestion can ever work.   (A) It begins "you should", which is like beginning with "you people":  listening stops almost immediately.  And, (B) it includes "change course" which is always unwelcome: it reflects badly on the previous course.

If someone has decided to change course and is asking which new course they should pursue, you can, sometimes, influence them.  To actually change tack, they must see the rocks ahead: they must be desperate, in fear of being fired, and have already decided to fire everyone and start in a new direction.

Remember: **change is bad** . It's bad because it's disruptive and disruption is risky and risk == cost. (Note, risk does not actually == cost, risk is only "potential cost". Every manager on the planet will **act**   based on the claim that risk == actual cost.)

[BTW, most managers who decline to consider open source software are, of course, liars and/or schizophrenics because they already have oodles of open source software. That's not the issue. Really, that's just the usual background level of schizophrenia and mendacity.]

The only time when anyone will actually consider open source software is when they are in a "go out of business or get fired" situation.

The solution more likely to be accepted is one which dovetails with existing technology. If they are using Java, they want to hear more of the same. If they are using VB/C#, they want to hear more of the same. Unless they're already a Python shop, Django doesn't fill the "more of the same" criteria.

That's why a POC is so powerful.  Once the horse is out of the barn, we're no longer seeking permission, we're now into negotiation how much more of this can be permitted.

Playing to Their Strong Suit

Here's the suggestion they made.  This, too, is fraught with peril.  "Suggestion: Make some assumptions and give the client an ROI number".

Sorry, I'm not a fan of ROI for these kinds of projects.  ROI rarely makes sense with tooling questions, since we're talking about IT's internal ROI.  IT is a cost center:  the whole ROI thing is on it's ear because there isn't a positive "return", just the potential of reduced costs at some time in the future.  Boring.

Further, software-related ROI requires a lot of supporting opinion.  It's rarely fact-based because we are usually unable to do nifty side-by-side comparisons of team A using toolset #1 and team B using toolset #2 to build the Same Application.  Software development isn't manufacturing; very little of it is trivially repeatable like this.  Who would buy the same software twice in order to do a head-to-head comparison between toolsets?

The closest you can come to ROI is a pilot project.  Wait!  Isn't that just a proof of concept?

ROI is a lot of assumptions in a big report that gets you the inevitable "No."  Realistic, fact-based ROI looks too small.  Assumptions that serve to bump up the ROI get challenged.

Your Competitors Don't Do This

No one asked Microsoft for an ROI on Visual Studio 8.  No one asked Oracle for an ROI on using PL/SQL for every piece of custom code.  No one asked Sun to provide detailed ROI numbers for introduction of J2EE web servers.  Nope.  Not a single ROI number was used for these decisions.

Tooling requires POC.  You can't induce anything without tangible proof that the proposed tool beats the pants off the incumbent tool.
