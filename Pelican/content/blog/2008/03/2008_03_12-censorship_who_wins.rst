See `GoDaddy Silences Police Watchdog Site RateMyCop.com <http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/03/godaddy-silence.html>`_ .  As of 3/12/08, GoDaddy won't comment.



So far, they didn't produce a takedown notice, or even notify the owner.  So I guess this means GoDaddy is not a good choice for hosting or Domain Name registration.  The good news is the list of hosting services is still quite long.



The content could be viewed as politically challenging, but it sure looked like citizen oversight of government operations.  If the government doesn't like to be watched... as they say, if you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.  Oh wait -- since '98, it should be -- if you can't take the heat, slap them with a legal process that makes the heat too expensive to maintain.



Bullying



DMCA copyright takedown notices are just a technique for bullying in web space.  While there may be some legitimate copyright issues, many of them are simple power plays.



See `Air Force Cyber Command's New Weapon: DMCA Notice <http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/03/air-force-cyber.html>`_ s for illegal use of DMCA notices by a government agency.  That's doubly bad - the government (especially the military) is already a bully.  Using pseudo-legalistic threats is just more bullying.



DMCA as a bullying technique is distressing.  See `EFF's Online Policy Group v. Diebold <http://www.eff.org/cases/online-policy-group-v-diebold>`_ .  While clearly illegal, it takes a lot of expensive lawyering to defend yourself against DMCA notices.  What you can do against GoDaddy -- who simply shut you off, I don't know.  You can only sue for damages, but the dollar value of the damages will barely cover the lawyers.



:strong:`Copyright` 



I like to read the various analyses of intellectual property on `Boing Boing <http://www.boingboing.net>`_ .  Particularly regarding the silliness of current copyright law.  Once the original creator is dead, who benefits from the copyright?  Lawyers.  The Disney Corporation.



One consequence of Disney's pursuit of insane copyright durations the DMCA and my inability to copy my DVD's to make backups.  Brilliant strategy -- punish the consumer.  Look at the history of the `SONY Rootkit <http://www.boingboing.net/2005/11/14/sony-anticustomer-te.html>`_  hacks that damaged people's computers.



And don't waste my time on the piracy stupidity.  Why buy a $3.00 badly executed cheap copy of a movie when I can spend $19 for the real deal? I want movie :strong:`and`  the bonus content in a case that doesn't have spelling mistakes.   When will the production companies finally recognize that DVD sales don't cannibalize the theatrical sales?  Probably never.



There will always be people who brag about getting a knock-off at 1/10th the price that's "just as good". Those annoying people are loud, but they aren't the demographic who :strong:`buys`  a product.  They're the demographic who buys knock-offs of a product, complaining the whole time.  Focus on the demographic that spends money -- ramp up the quality, the bonus features, the frequent buyer points, the advance notices and other love and care that rewards purchasing rather than punishing it.



Perhaps GoDaddy will join others in citing some goofy copyright thing as the reason for censoring a site.  It didn't work for Diebold.  It shouldn't work for GoDaddy.  Too bad it costs so much in legal fees to assert the right to free speech.
