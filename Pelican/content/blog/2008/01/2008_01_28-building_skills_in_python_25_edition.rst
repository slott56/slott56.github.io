I've upgraded my 
`Building Skills in Python <http://www.itmaybeahack.com/homepage/books/python.html>`_
to cover the 2.5 release.  It didn't take as long as I'd anticipated.

The new features list for Python 2.5 is mercifully short.  I did a fair amount of reorganization to consolidate some things that had grown or split needlessly.

Changes include

-   The if-then-else expression

-   The any() and all() functions

-   The string partition() method, as well as changes to startswith() and endswith()

-   Some changes to the coverage of exceptions

-   Changes to the coverage of the  ``yield``  statement

-   A section on the new ``with``  statement

-   A complete rewrite of part IV to reflect the new Library Reference organization

-   Changes to the coverage of datetime and csv modules.

-   Additional material on the Python command-line.

-   Additional material on Properties and Descriptors.

That was fun.
