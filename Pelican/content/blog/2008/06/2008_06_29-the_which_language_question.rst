Here's how it shakes out from my point of view.  You could say that my bias is showing.  I think, however, I have solid evidence for my opinions.



**C++**.  Fine if you like memory management.  Don't get me wrong, some people love the nitty-gritty details.  Some people would prefer to write an operating system than an application;  C++ is great for that.  I think this is only manageable if you add in a smart-pointer package and a very sophisticated collections framework. 



**Perl**.  This language is showing it's age.  The object-orientation features look more like a clumsy afterthought than a first-class part of the language.  I've already ripped up Perl for simple web applications in "`After Perl, What? <{filename}/blog/2006/01/2006_01_27-after_perl_what_revised.rst>`_ ".  In that posting, I suggested that PHP was better for the specific problem domain and skill set of the team.  I don't generally recommend PHP, but it fit their situation.



**Ruby**.  This language has a lamentably obscure syntax.  It's probably good, but there is a feeling that Ruby tends to be write-once code.  Further, Ruby's popularity may be entirely based on the Ruby on Rails web framework, not on any inherent language feature.



**Python**.  Easy-to-read syntax (better than Ruby or Perl).  Automatic memory management (better than C++).  Good object-orientation without a lot of overheads (better than Java or Perl).  I've found it to be very easy to learn and a very productive work environment.



Python has an explicit "batteries included" philosophy.  You should have almost everything you need right out of the box.  The single most important add-on is the `Easy Install <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall>`_  package.  Given that, you can download almost anything else you might need with a trivial command-line request.



**Other Contenders.**



There are two contenders not mentioned in the email: PHP and Java.



**PHP**.  Limited by the "all-in-one" packaging.  PHP has a lot of functions added into the language itself.  Python doesn't add to the language; it has a small core interpreter, surrounded by add-on libraries.  new libraries can be added freely, old libraries can be replaced.   PHP lacks this growth path.



**Java**.  A close runner-up to Python; it has similar advantages.  The one disadvantage is the very fussy static typing model that limits productivity -- you can't simply refactor a class; you have to totally restructure the entire inheritance hierarchy.



**Bottom Line**



Learn Python.



If, for business or political reasons Python won't fly, Java is the other choice.



There are numerous good on-line and off-line books on Python.  I like mine, but that's just me.  You might like the price (free for now); you also might like the fact that I can update the text almost immediately.



-   `How to Write Your Own Software Using Python <http://www.itmaybeahack.com/homepage/books/nonprogrammer.html>`_ .  This is for absolute beginners -- folks who are unclear on "programming".

-   `Building Skills in Python <http://www.itmaybeahack.com/homepage/books/python.html>`_ .  This is for programmers who know at least one other language, and want to learn Python.  This has four parts to cover the language basics, data structures using the built-in collection classes, object design, and higher-level structures (components, modules and packages).

-   `Building Skills in Object-Oriented Design <http://www.itmaybeahack.com/homepage/books/oodesign.html>`_ .  This is a more advanced book for Java or Python programmers.  It builds a rather complex real-world application, class by class.

There are numerous other introductions to Python.  Most of them are really good.  I like mine because I have a gentle progression from simple to complex topics that I based (loosely) on the approach taken by [Holt78] R. C. Holt, G. S. Graham, E. D. Lazowska, and M. A. Scott.
