In the `Small Not-for-Profit Web Presence <{filename}/blog/2008/07/2008_07_28-small_not_for_profit_web_presence_what_to_do.rst>`_  posting, I identified a software portfolio for a small NFP.  Basically, it was a list of cheap (or free) web resources that would provide a solid web presence with relatively low cost.  More importantly, it would move them off a legacy web presence that was completely customized, but wasn't really very well implemented.





It turns out that, small for-profit businesses (especially sole proprietorships) can benefit from assembling a web presence out of Google Pages (or Yahoo! Geocities), a Blog, a Google Calendar and (possibly) a Google or Yahoo! group.  They also need a CRM solution (CLPsuite or Salesforce.com).



However, instead of CRM, Member Management (MM, sometimes called Member Relationship Management to parallel Customer Relationship Management) is a potential part of the software portfolio for a small not-for-profit (NFP).  The NFP I was helping gets their support through grants and donations of time from the principals.  Member Management doesn't enter into their picture at all.



However, clubs and churches are member supported.  For them, member management might make some sense.



Web-Based Member Management
----------------------------



First, look at Capterra's Enterprise Software Directory under `Membership Management <http://www.capterra.com/membership-management-software>`_ .  It's a pretty good list.  Also, look under `Church Membership Software <http://www.capterra.com/church-management-software>`_ .



The first problem is that some of these are toolkits, not complete, stand-alone applications.  A toolkit means you are programming and programming means you aren't really small (or aren't focused on your primary NFP mission.)



The second problem is that you have to choose between Customer Relationship Management and Member Management.  My Small NFP (and many small sole proprietorships) needs CRM (i.e. CLPsuite or Salesforce.com).  They don't need MM in any form.



Synchronicity
--------------



You can't be synchronizing between member mailing lists.  You must chose one and only one approach.  The cost and complexity will suck the life out of your organization.  You can do bulk notifications to members with any of the following techniques:



1.  A Yahoo! Group or Google Group.



2.  A CRM solution (CLPsuite or Salesforce).



3.  A Member Management solution.



4.  RSS or ATOM feeds based on your blog or web page changes.  This is pull, not push technology, so you won't really know who's reading your material.  This is very Web 2.0, but not very comfortable for people addicted to pushing their message.



Connectivity and Spamulation
-----------------------------



The RSS/ATOM issue is important.  When I talk about this with Small NFP's, I call all bulk email *spam*.  Even the "good" opt-in email that people sign up for is still -- in a way -- spam.



Small NFP's bristle when I call their email spam.  First, it's opt-in email.  People asked for it.



But more importantly, some of the folks have the need to be **sure**  (really *sure*) that their message is getting out.  Here's my bad news: you can't be sure anyone's reading your email newsletter.  If it doesn't get spam-filtered, it can still get ignored.  You just never know.



With RSS/ATOM, they asked and they checked for updates.  This is much, much more effective than an email list.



Member Management Solutions
---------------------------



I don't have much real advice here.  When you Google for "web based member management software", you get a bunch of hits, include Wild Apricot, Tendenci, ARC Solutions, IRM-Systems.
