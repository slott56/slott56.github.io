It's time for me to reconcile my web content and blogs among all the
freebie hosting sites:

1) `Mindspring <http://www.mindspring.com/~slott1>`_

#) `Roadrunner <http://home.nycap.rr.com/slott>`_

#) `.Mac <http://homepage.mac.com/s_lott>`_

#) `Geocities <http://www.geocities.com/s_lott/>`_




Mindspring and Roadrunner are
duplicates, as a test of something or other.  .Mac is built by the Apple iLife
tools, and is a place to play with those.  Geocities.  Hmm.  Why do I have that
again?
