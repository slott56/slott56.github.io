    Neither was I until I read your reply.



    I did  not know enough to formulate the correct question.
    What I was struggling was when do you use simple
    hyperlinks/html vs a content mgr vs a database.
    I finally have some rules of thumb to select
    between them.

    Ooops. Did not intend to imply this. Sometimes
    google is great, at othe times, I get overwhelmed
    by the results. That is why I buy books. Books
    provide me w/ context and structure.
    


Which
seems to lead to the following:



1)  If you have very little content or very little structure to your content, you
    can manage the links manually.  Little content means that you can't justify the
    expense.  little structure means that you can't formalize the structure in a way
    that your content manager can be used
    effectively.



2)  If you have enough
    content to justify the expense and some structure, get a content manager to
    track links properly, and keep the current and consistent.  Some problems are
    amenable to a content manager, but not structured enough for an
    RDBMS.



3)  If you have content and
    enough structure to justify the effort required to represent it in a database,
    then generate HTML (and the like) from a RDBMS source.
