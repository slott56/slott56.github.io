..  todo:: Are any of these lkinks still live?


Why Python?  Stay tuned.  Why Zope?  More to come.



`HTML Parse
Tree <http://old.zope.org/Members/slott/HTMLParseTree>`_   and related material - needs a proper Python install
script.



`PyWeb <http://old.zope.org/Members/slott/pyweb>`_   - needs some
updates and a proper install
script.



Additional projects:



`Random
Number Test <http://www.mindspring.com/~slott1/steve/python/rngdoc.html>`_   Algorithms, plus an implementation of some higher-order
math functions for developing chi-squared test values.  There are many sources
for this information, but it was fun to do the research and develop the
algorithm.  I'm not a mathematician, but I could play one on daytime soap
operas.



COBOL `Data
Definition Element <http://www.mindspring.com/~slott1/steve/python/DDE.html>`_   parsing and data
processing.



`Transitive
Closure <http://www.mindspring.com/~slott1/steve/python/transclose.html>`_
demonstration.



And I'm working
on a web workload
simulator.



Plus, for those of
us with big disk drives and small media - a utility to make a bunch of Zip
files, each no bigger than a specific media (say 250Mb for old Zip disks, or
600Mb for CD burning).  Preliminary tests show that it is really horribly slow,
but simple.
