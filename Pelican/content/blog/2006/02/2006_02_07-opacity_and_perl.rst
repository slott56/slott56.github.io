In my case, the opacity of Perl actually wasn't
entirely my opinion.  I was contacted by folks that were struggling with Perl. 
In one case, they specifically lifted up the opacity problem.  "If my partner
gets hit by the bus, I can't maintain these web
sites."



In the other case, the opacity
was something they danced around.  The backbone of their application is Perl. 
They have to make extensive changes.  They can't easily support those changes
with the structure they have.  Rather than touch the backbone, they want a far
more sophisticated web front-end.  That's probably spending money in the wrong
place.  Simplifying or replacing the Perl coupled with incremental improvements
to the web presentation may be a much smarter way to spend the
money.



So, the opacity problem isn't
mine.  Indeed, I can read Perl just fine. 




However, I can't read XSLT at all.  I
really have to struggle with it.  I've often (see `Not the first time <{filename}/blog/2003/12/2003_12_13-not_the_first_time.rst>`_) wondered about the lure of XML and XSLT
and I just don't see it.



I think we
agree that opacity is a serious problem.  While you may not see it in Perl, we
both see the cost and complexity that stems from difficult-to-read software. 
The point of software is to capture knowledge.  If you can't read it, then how
well was it captured?
