In it, Bruce Silver recollects process
reengineering gurus who warned "Don't pave the cowpaths!".  Presumably because
the cow path was a random walk all over the pasture land, and wasn't the most
efficient course.



However, anyone who
was watched cows at work will tell you that the cow path is absolutely the most
efficient possible path.  It may wander, but it follows the contours of the land
to minimize the energy the cow expends wandering from food to barn and back to
food.



I think the metaphor, while
colorful, may not be completely apt.  The point about automating a
poorly-designed legacy process is very important.  Maybe there's a better
metaphor for this bad behavior.



Since
cows (and most animals) are ruthlessly lazy, we have to be careful about
metaphors based on their behavior.  Automating a badly-designed business process
is more like putting people-movers in a labyrinth than it is like paving a
cow-path.  A bad business process, like a maze, is something people create to
make the walking around more important than reaching the goal.  Walk through a
garden maze, and you'll see that the point of it is to conceal the
goal.



Since "paving the cowpath" is
shorter and more colorful than "putting a people mover in the labyrinth", I
can't offer any real literary improvement.  But I like my formula better because
it points to the root-cause problem a little more clearly.
