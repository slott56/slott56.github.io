RL says, "Really nice article. It seems that Perl
does not have frameworks ? http://www.haloscan.com/comments/slott/E20060126195803/#59841"



At
first I didn't understand the comment.  Then I realized that my premise -- Perl
is obsolete -- was buried under a pile of other
information.



Somehow my "So step one is
the following advice: Ditch Perl" got lost.  I'll have to figure out a good
rewrite that makes this point even more
prominent.



The consequence of this
point is that it doesn't matter what Perl offers.  Perl is too opaque for
serious programming that has long-term value.   Any Perl-based framework is
going to be difficult to maintain.  It doesn't matter how brilliant
**Catalyst** 
is -- the underlying Perl is just too hard to
read.



There is an alternative.  One
could follow the
**Zope** 
path and use XML extensively and Python minimally to build a web application. 
The logical consequence of minimizing the emphasis on Python is that Zope can
support customization using Perl.




However, my point remains:  Ditch
Perl.  Consequently, the frameworks question is moot.
