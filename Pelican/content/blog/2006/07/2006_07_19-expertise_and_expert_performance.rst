It appears that I may have been doing the right
thing in putting together `Building Skills in Object-Oriented Design <http://www.itmaybeahack.com/homepage/books/oodesign.html>`_ .
Expertise is grown through "effortful study" of the material.  Experts search
through their long-term memory for applicable patterns, based on their
study.



The idea of many exercises, each
exposing a piece of OO design seems to fit this "effortful study"
niche.



The next step is to rewrite
parts of the introduction, and change the sales pitch.
