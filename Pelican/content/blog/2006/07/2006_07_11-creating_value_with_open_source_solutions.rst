What is the reward structure for open source? 




If a corporate IT team builds software
using open source components, CP insists, they've made a fundamental blunder.  I
forget CP's litany of concerns, but he worries that the software is unproven,
untrustworthy, risky, etc., etc.



My argument that "you have the source" means nothing to CP, since any commercial
license also has a complex source-escrow clause that -- he claims -- provides
the same level of assurance.  Unless, of course, your commercial package is no
longer officially supported, then all bets are off.  But somehow, lawyers will
cover this base to CP's satisfaction, and actually having the source isn't as
good.



But CP does raise one point of
some value:  what about innovation?  What happens when the open source author
moves on, and the package
stagnates?



Rewarding Innovation
--------------------



First, open source tends
to be far more innovative than commercial products.  We have to separate open
source from individual efforts.  In CP's world, open source means an individual
developer slaving away for the love of the craft.  This is often false, and
consequently, misleading.



An individual
contributor's rewards are clearly different from an open source community's
reward structure.  And, of course, corporate users of open source have their own
internal rewards, as well as a contribution to the open source author (or
community) rewards.  Since all of these are separate, it's helpful to have a
nice Information Week article to lay out some of the
issues.



Corporate IT Rewards
--------------------



As a consumer of OS
projects, a corporate IT department is rewarded by implementing (a) cheap, and
(b) effective solutions to problems.  Open Source software tends to be more
standardized than commercial products, making it more adaptable.  Further, the
presence of the source, makes it easier to understand, adapt and maintain.  It's
a big win, all the way around.



But how can corporate IT reward an open source community or the authors?



Acknowledgment is a
significant part of the reward structure.  Corporate IT should clearly and
boldly document the technology stack for the various applications that are built
and maintained.  Intranet web sites should have links and logos for the OS
projects.  Since corporate users now have to support the OS project, they should
become active, visible members of the
community.



Serious use of Open Source
projects means that the solution developers can find problems, extensions and
new directions.  Much of this can help the open source community.  Feedback --
in the form of fixes and extensions -- is what validates the design of an Open
Source project.  This intellectual investment increases the value of the
project.



What About Money?
------------------



Money is always a good thing.
Some open source authors have day jobs because their open source project
is so valuable.  A company is willing to put up with time spent nurturing an
open source community, in order to maximize the value from the open source
project. 



In the more common case, the
open source author has a day job and builds open source solutions entirely
outside their work life.  Their company is unwilling to foster an open source
community.  Or their company doesn't make direct use of the open source project.




Perhaps the most rare situation arises
with OS projects that also have commercially usable counterparts.  MySQL, for
example, has a commercial license, as well as supporting an open source
community.



Conflicts and Shifts
---------------------



Babcock's article identifies
the conflicting goals of creating proprietary solutions that include open source
components.  This provides some prominent reasons why open source contributors
aren't rewarded appropriately for their
contributions.



Perhaps, however, as open source use matures, the economics will shift.



Currently, we have two ways of
using open source components.

1.  **Blind Trust**.  We download it, use it, and hope that
    the rest of the community has thoroughly vetted the project.  This is the way
    most organizations use products like Apache or Linux.  They just download it and
    use it without giving it much more thought than that.

#.  **Healthy Respect**.  We download it, put it through an
    acceptance test cycle, and determine that it is fit for purpose and can be used
    in our in-house solutions.



There are
many war stories where people find that open source was expensive, perhaps
because of the support required.  This is not a third scenario, because it leads
to open source being banned or deprecated.  Once consequence of an official
position against open sources is that it forces the organization to use PERL,
Apache and Linux in **Blind Trust** mode.



Using Open Source software in **Healthy Respect**  mode means that we put OS projects
through the same processes we put our in-house solutions.

-   **Configuration Management**.  Rather than simply downloading
    blindly, someone is in charge of a subversion (or CVS) repository for the latest
    and greatest, the official, the development and the testing releases of open
    source packages.  This person can create value in the OS community by validating
    the releases.

-   **Testing**.  Rather than implementing blindly,
    someone has specific use cases, and conducts performance, integration, and
    functional tests.  This person can create value in the OS community by reporting
    bugs.

-   **Patching**.  Rather than deprecating OS
    software, someone can look into the problem, and determine if it is fixable and
    how to share the fix.

-   **Extending**.  Perhaps the most valuable
    contribution from a mature organization is the extensions and new directions for
    an open source project.



All of these quality-related activities feed back to the open source community.  But more
importantly, the people being paid to do this work, are being paid to create and
maintain open source projects.



This mature use of open source puts a solid, predictable, corporate-friendly reward
structure in place.  Once people are paid to contribute, the "business risks"
are eliminated; eliminated in the sense that being able to explain the reward
structure to lawyers and accountants reduces the sillier objections to open
source solutions.
