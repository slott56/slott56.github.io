In the CW article, pseudonymous Mathias Thurman
describes a demonstration of Microsoft's `Rights Management Services <http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/rightsmgmt/default.mspx>`_  product.  The
audience of executives identify a number of "Suppose..." scenarios, which the
author dismisses as merely research subjects, concluding that "...the goal of
this proof of concept was to introduce a group of executives to a technology
that, if deployed properly, could prevent the theft of intellectual property and
save the company money. I believe I accomplished that
goal."



I suppose, for a number of values of "could", this is true.



But
looking at the EFF's material, specifically, "`How DRM Doesn't Work <http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/001632.php>`_ ?" I'm convinced that
there's a logical fallacy in DRM that makes the entire idea logically
impossible.  Specifically, you're looking to control an end-users computer. 
Generally, controlling someone else's computer is a criminal activity when we
consider viruses and DDoS attacks.  Further, there are inevitable "support"
issues because of upgrades, failure to upgrade and incompatibilities with other
DRM schemes that the user is trying to be part
of.



In short, DRM can't be made to work.



And the glorious part of the CW
article is that the logical fallacies are framed as "Suppose..." questions.  The
two that are included in the article are marvelous.  I'd love to see the whole
list of 15 or so.  That would like be a list of 15 more reasons why DRM can't be
made to work.



Two Specific Scenarios
----------------------



Here are two specific
scenarios from the article:  “Suppose that I needed to view a protected
document at a customer site,” or, “Suppose I wanted to send a
protected document to someone who wasn’t an employee.” 




Both of these are the kind of
monumental obstacles that reveal the logical impossibility of
DRM.



Viewing protected content when you
don't have access to the authorization server is a serious restriction that is
insurmountable.  While you can -- in principle -- create an indefinite number of
customer VPN connections, you will inevitably have issues with a customer. 
Either it will be technical (their stuff is too old, too new or too Linux) or it
will be legal (they don't permit that kind of
thing.)



Giving a protected document to
a non-employee means that you have to admin an indefinite number of unknown
individuals into your protection scheme.  Employees -- at least in principle --
are trustworthy.  Except the ones you have to fire for criminal activity on
company property.  Non-employees must be untrustworthy, requiring them to be
vetted as if they were prospective employees: background checks, interviews,
photo ID checks, immigration paperwork, etc.  All of which *inhibits*
potentially valuable use of the intellectual property by increasing the cost of
access -- possibly to an unacceptable level.



These aren't technical nits, to
be overcome with clever use Live ID or Active Directory.  These are logical
impossibilities.  You can't reach into everyone's computer and everyone's
network to secure your intellectual property.  You can't vet every potential
user and still have a reasonable cost-to-use.  Either you can't let it out of
the server room, or you have to trust
someone.



The other choice is to make
the IP so compellingly valuable that you'll make money anyway.  The `Red
Hat business model <http://digitalenterprise.org/cases/redhat.html>`_  strikes me as a better direction in which to head.
While Copy-Friendly business models are too new, it makes more sense to monetize
what people want to do (spread your IP around).  If spreading your IP around can
find more customers, isn't that better than locking it away in the server
room?
