The following weirdness often happens when we
encounter complex business problems.

1.  The users hate something and want new
    software.  They justify a project to spend $100K replacing something that
    appears broken.

#.  The Business Analyst notes a control issue
    that is really a conflict between software functionality and business rewards. 


#.  The resulting conversation leads to
    organizational changes.

#.  The software development project schedule must
    be changed to accommodate the change.

#.  This cycle of business change and software
    change repeats a few times.  We are still "analyzing" and haven't produced much.


#.  The project changes are declared "out of
    control" and the project is
    cancelled.



Some good things happened,
but the final result -- somehow -- appears bad.  One result of the business
analysis could have been a rewrite of the application to put in the "20-minute
solution"; a simple application which correctly captured the information,
supported the decisions and the
actions.



The weirdness is, of course,
compounded by the famous "schedule compression" technique.  This is where IT
spins up analysts, architects, designers and programmers all at once.  When the
analysts throw firecrackers into the hen-house, what is everyone else supposed
do to while waiting for the users to settle down
again?



**Is All Change Disruptive?** 



Yes.  Otherwise, it
isn't real change, just incremental adjustment.  In some cases, an adjustment is
all we need.  If so, we don't need a lot of business analysis and software
development.  If we're making incremental process improvements, then the
analysis won't ask disruptive
questions.



When analysts uncover
discrepancies between "requirements" and the behavior that is rewarded in the
user organization, then there are three consequences:

1.  Change will be disruptive: either behavior or
    requirements must change.

#.  The requested software can only be part of the
    change: behavior is the other part.

#.  The reward system will have to change, and the
    software has to fit into that revised reward
    system.



If the key stakeholders don't
express this as a change to the organization, then it's just disruption, and no
one likes that.  Projects will be
cancelled.



**User-Initiated Change** 



One comment http://www.haloscan.com/comments/slott/E20060405120217/#85108 points at my lack of clarity here.
"Change implies questioning ones assumptions. Even if we can get users to do
that, we still have to actually get them to do the hard work of making changes."
This quote reveals that the topic (user-initiated change) wasn't clearly
articulated.



Change can -- eventually
-- result in an IT project being cancelled.  Good things happened, but the
project only catalyzed the change, and wasn't really part of it.  Since this is
user-initiated change, the comment doesn't apply.  The user's
**did** 
change their assumptions, and took on the hard work of making a change. 




The project was cancelled and IT was
blamed -- blamed! -- for a failed project.  What was the real failure?  Failure
to change and improve?  No.  It was a failure to engage in a technology
hobby.



Avoiding change can either lead
to the cancellation of a project, or -- worse -- grumpiness with the result. 
The comment ("even if we can get users to do that") appears to stem from IT is
**forcing** 
change on users, a situation that makes no sense at all.  If we're in the
situation where users won't question their assumptions, then we have to ask
progressively more disruptive questions until they elect to
change.



**Tangent: Refusing to Change** 



I don't really want to talk
about flat refusal to change.   I mention it here only because this tangent may
be the meaning behind the comment.  If so, the comment is pretty far off topic. 




The topic can be summarized as
follows:

-   Sometimes user-initiated change leads to
    project cancellation

-   Project cancellation is an IT failure,
    irrespective of the benefits or the origin of the
    change.



Refusal to change just doesn't
match the topic very well at all.  The topic is about IT being a catalyst for
change, but not participating in the change by building
software.



Here's the situation: during
analysis we find contradictions -- requirements don't match behavior -- and the
contradictions can't be worked resolved.  We're in a tight spot.  The users
demand change in the form of new software, and refuse to change their behaviors,
then what is IT to do?  The project is going to get cancelled or denigrated as a
waste of money.  Which makes more business sense?
