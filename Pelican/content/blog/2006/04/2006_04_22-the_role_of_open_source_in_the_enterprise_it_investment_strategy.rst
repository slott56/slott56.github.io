My point -- always -- is that I'm not here to
**convert** 
anyone.  I'm just here to respond to the need for open source consulting
skills.



As a parallel example, TH
explained (at length) that there was NO earthly reason to retire a perfectly
good IBM z-series mainframe.  The z-series represents cheap, reliable,
predictable, high-value, paid-for, processing power.  My point to him is not
that I have a better business model, or that I have a compelling argument for
conversion.  I only know that our firm has customers undertaking the
conversion.



Thank goodness for articles
like Information Week's http://www.informationweek.com/ "Red Hat Seizes an Opening" http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=185302881.  This article paints the picture very
clearly:

1.  Businesses are using open source
    software.

#.  It doesn't matter that you can't see the
    justification.

#.  There it is.  Deal with it.



I really like that.  It helps me to
get past the "I just don't see the value" part of the conversation.  That's not
the point.



It helps move the
conversation onto the more interesting topics:

1.  What open source packages should we focus on?

#.  Is there a business angle in open source
    support for `CTG <http://www.ctg.com>`_ ?

#.  How can we be sure that our customers turn to
    us first?

#.  Is there more that we can do to help customers
    considering open source?



And, it helps
to have the Red Hat Business Model documented somewhere.  I believe it is the
coming model for all consulting firms.
