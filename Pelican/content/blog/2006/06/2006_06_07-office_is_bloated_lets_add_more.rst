"There has been a lot of skepticism about the
usefulness--and necessity--of the Ribbon, and I have to admit that I was among
the doubters. Why change something that works? Because, according to Microsoft,
the current interface has become bloated with too many
menus."



Ugh.  It's bloated, so we'll
add features to conceal the bloat.  Great approach.  Feed the obese, hand anvils
to the drowning, throw gasoline on the
fire.



Why do we buy
this?



I think it's because we don't see
a choice.  OpenOffice http://www.openoffice.org/ is risky, too new, feature poor or some
such malarky.  All false, but who wants to be first to jump ship?  Not my
company's IT department.



I wish that
"Big IT" (the architects in Fortune 500 companies) would survey users and
examine documents to find out what
**really** 
happens with users of MS-Office products.  I suspect the 80-20 rule would apply
and they'd see the following:

-   10% of the users are power-users who can
    do nice high-quality publication, using style sheets and other tools.  These
    people are essentially professional layout/editor writer types or the kind of
    jack-of-all-trade administrative assistants who support a power
    user.

-   They'd find 80% of the ordinary user
    community who can write a document and are happy with that.  This breaks down
    into the 16% who can use the spell checker and know what the grammar checker is
    doing, and the 64% who can't use the spell checker and turn the grammar checker
    off.

-   They'd find the weird 10% of people who
    misuse Word egregiously.  These are people who make giant spreadsheet-like
    tables because they can't figure out Excel, or who make hyper-complex
    interlinked documents because they can't figure out FrontPage.  These are the
    people writing VBA scripts and attaching them to documents to automate something
    that has little or nothing to do with
    Word.



If users would complain about how
Office is structured, perhaps we could get many simple applications that really
work instead of a few bloated, complex applications that we can barely
use.



When they went to the hidden and
optional menu items, I was already baffled by the complexity of the product. 
When they put functions that
**only** 
appear when you right click the right UI element, I hated it.  Now, they've had
to do away with their menu structure altogether because they won't fix the root
cause (bloat) and instead elect to add to
it.



Here's the
bottom-line.

**If the menu structure isn't obvious, you're working with the wrong metaphors.**

Apple's Human Interface Guidelines
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/index.html are pretty
clear.



"Take advantage
of people’s knowledge of the world by using metaphors to convey concepts
and features of your application. Metaphors are the building blocks in the
user’s mental model of a task. Use metaphors that represent concrete,
familiar ideas, and make the metaphors obvious, so that users can apply a set of
expectations to the computer environment."
