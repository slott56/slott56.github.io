Here's how to recognize a
**Faerie Dust**
request:



1.  We have identified a
problem.  It can be with almost anything: scalability, reliability,
auditability, any `Quality Measure <http://www.sei.cmu.edu/str/taxonomies/view_qm.html>`_ .


2.  We're pursuing a specific technology. 
Typically, something that has the lowest impact on our
architecture.

3.  We can't address anything
other than this specific technology variation -- we can't change the application
software or buy hardware.



Once we're in
the Faerie Dust realm, what can we
do?



Laughing doesn't help.  They have a
serious problem, they need a solution.  The fact that they won't address the
cause isn't completely relevant -- we have to work on the denial, anger,
negotiation, depression cycle first.  Hopefully skipping past the anger, or
assuring the anger is directed
elsewhere.



Helping doesn't help.  If we
join the quest for their Faerie Dust, what will we accomplish?  We'll burn
billable hours to -- eventually -- reach an equivocal non-solution with a
complex write-up and recommendations that won't be
implemented.



Not helping doesn't help. 
If we obstinately refuse to join the quest for the Faerie Dust... well... then
we've done nothing.  We haven't advanced their understanding of their
problem.



What's left?  Is there a
middle road that allows us to join the Faerie Dust quest, but still point out
the side roads, other monsters and other treasures along the
way?



Perhaps there is, but it would
require a kind of saintly patient persistence.  We would have to start with an
enumeration of problem causes, prioritize them, and then focus on their selected
bit of Faerie Dust.  My idea is that enumerating the possible causes allows us
to identify the missed opportunities, and the possible magnitude of fixing
something essential (algorithm or data structure) instead of throwing up
window-dressing to cover problems in something inessential (reducing the time
required for a table scan).
