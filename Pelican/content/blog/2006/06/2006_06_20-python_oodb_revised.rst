Simple object persistence (i.e., serialization to
a file system) is what pickle, marshal and shelve
do.



However, here's the next thing of
some interest OODB's.



Zope's `ZODB <http://www.zope.org/Wikis/ZODB/FrontPage>`_ .  The original OODB for Python, the
backbone of Zope.



`buzhug <http://buzhug.sourceforge.net/>`_ :
"a fast, pure-Python database engine, using a syntax that Python programmers
should find very intuitive."



`PyPerSyst <http://pypersyst.org/>`_  "fast,
reliable, and flexible object persistence with a small footprint, suitable for
embedding in other Python
applications."



`CouchDB <http://couchdb.infogami.com/>`_  "A
stand-alone document store, [which] most closely resembles the Lotus
Notes/Domino storage engine."



`ObjectivityDB/Python <http://www.objectivity.com/blogs/insider/expert_opinion/languages/python/>`_  "a high performance and
robust Object-Oriented Database Management System [ODBMS]."




`Axiom <http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodAxiom>`_  "Axiom is an object database, or
alternatively, an object-relational mapper."  The pleasant thing is that you
don't really care which.



`Durus <https://www.mems-exchange.org/software/durus/>`_  "a persistent object system for
applications written in the Python programming
language."



http://www.itamarst.org/software/cog/
(not `CoG <http://wiki.cogkit.org/index.php/Main_Page>`_ , the Commodity Grid) is the Checkpointed
Object Graph, which provides "semi-transparent persistence for large sets of
interrelated Python objects."
