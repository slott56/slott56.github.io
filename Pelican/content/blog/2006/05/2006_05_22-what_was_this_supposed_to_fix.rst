This is the part that helped me understand this:
"It was kind of like a miracle drug," [Ruth Samuelson] said. "It's going to do
all this stuff and I just didn't think it was
possible."



It appears to me, just
reading this account, that there wasn't a clearly articulated problem.  Perhaps
the reporter is only summarizing, but the quote "The state and county had long
wanted to make a largely paper-driven court system more efficient and speed up
arrest processing, among other things" says a lot: "more efficient" is wishful
thinking.



I wonder how this would have
played out if the criminal justice folks had a list of specific problems they
needed solved?



For example (again,
hypothesizing here), "County employees continued to test more than 30 versions
of the system in 2005, and documented problem after problem."  Did they have
concrete problems they were trying to solve?  Were they applying new technology
to older procedures?  



My experience is
that when you have a specific problem, the "solved" and "not solved" issues are
a little easier to lift up.  Documenting "problem after problem" sure sounds
like the users were exploring the software, rather than applying the
software.
