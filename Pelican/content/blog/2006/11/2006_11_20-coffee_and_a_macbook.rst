Happily, the MacBook isn't very hard to take
apart.  Also, since we could afford to replace it, we had two over the
Thanksgiving break, and could determine that there were no MagSafe power cord or
battery issues.



You can see a nice
`MacWorld video <http://youtube.com/watch?v=8c6ckjy-gdY>`_  of the basics of opening the
battery bay, removing RAM and Disk
Drive.



The disk and memory chips were
gunked with month-old coffee crud.  A scrub with a soft, cotton towel and plain
water got through a lot of it.  Then we started into alcohol, using medical
alcohol wipes so we could scrub without leaving a lot of linty residue.




The memory chips were simply scrubbed
with alcohol until the contacts were
clean-looking.



The serial ATA hard
drive is enclosed in a metal shroud, held on with four #8 Torx connectors. 
Under this was a circuit board with coffee stains.  It, too, got a thorough
scrubbing.



**Phase Two.** 



After cleaning the accessible
parts, we have to move into the guts of the machine.   The `Kodawarisan <http://www.kodawarisan.com/macbook/macbook001.html>`_  site had a great sequence of photos.
There are innumerable internal screws of at least four different styles: very
small, small, small with a little barrel, and long-ish.  All have to be kept
separate.  



It's hard to get a good
screwdriver angle on these things.  Radio Shack carries a `Kronus ratchet set <http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2062777&cp=&origkw=torx&kw=torx&parentPage=search>`_   with the necessary Phillips
and Torx heads.  This helps to break the screws loose without stripping them. 
Once loose, an ordinary precision screwdriver works
well.



Once all the internal screws have
been removed, the external screws come out.  They're all readily accessible, but
come in many shapes and sizes.  There are two lengths on the bottom, really
short ones on the left side, barrel screws on the right side, and a mixture of
mid-length and barrel-style on the back.  Keep them all separate.  A piece of
paper with labels for the various sizes and their locations is a big
help.



**Lifting the Lid.** 



The keyboard doesn't lift out
too gracefully.  The left side lifts a little more easily than the right. 
However, there's this really important piece of ribbon cable from the main
circuit board to the back side of the keyboard.  While wiggling things around
trying to get a good look at this, it dropped out of it's socket. 




Around the DVD drive are a number of
very small plastic clips that keep the keyboard and case all nicely aligned. 
These are prone to slipping out of position.  Don't loose these, and don't let
them go astray. These are critical to keeping the DVD slot and DVD reader
aligned correctly.



**Lather.  Rinse.  Repeat.** 



A number of web
sites indicate that isopropyl rubbing alcohol works well for cleaning circuit
boards.  However, we need to remove coffee, and we can't really get at the board
with much more than a swab and baby
toothbrush.



I tried a swab with
alcohol, followed by scrubbing with the baby toothbrush and found that this
works well.  I inspected just about every visible IC component for crud, moving
across the board from top-left to bottom right.  After a half-hour of squinting
through a hand-lens, we took a break, and returned after our eyeballs relaxed. 
Another half-hour of squinting, swabbing and scrubbing left the board looking
acceptable.



It didn't look new, but it
was also free from visible coffee stains.  Some of the contacts were discolored,
but the crud was removed.



**Test Drive.** 



For a test drive, I held the
keyboard in place, plugged in the power, and hit the power switch.  After being
dead for months, it recovered to where it was when my daughter filled it with
mocha java.   I was amazed.  



I did a
nice, controlled shutdown and started putting screws back in.  There are a lot
of them, and they are small.  Also, parts of the interior are magnetic, so the
screws don't behave well.



**False Hope.** 



Above, I noted that a number
of small, plastic clips keep the keyboard and case nicely aligned.  If these
aren't in position, the DVD slot doesn't line up with the DVD drive.  After I
reassembled everything, I had a part left over and an ugly lump near the DVD
drive slot.



I booted and ran through
the software upgrades she hadn't done.  When that was finished, I took it all
apart again.  I reseated the clips, and things went together much better the
second time around.  



The DVD that had
been in there still wouldn't come out.  To get it out, I had to pull the slot
open with just a fingernail on each side.  Once the slot was clear I did the
following. 




NOTE.
You may not want to do this, it sounds dangerous.  It probably is.  You might
break something.  You have been
warned.



I
put a small Phillips-head screwdriver into the DVD slot and wiggled it to seat
everything correctly.  Since there are delicate parts in there, I only put the
screwdriver in about 1/4" or less.  Wiggling the drive up and down in the slot
seemed to get it seated more squarely behind the slot.




**Victory.** 



The
MacBook seems to run just fine.  We'll resynch the files and send her back to
school with the coffee-stained machine.  The like-new replacement will go to
someone who needs a new computer: my son.
