"But Apple, stubbornly hanging on to its need to
control the user experience, creates meshed hardware and software systems that
deprive businesses of the flexibility to find the best balance of hardware,
operating system and applications for the job at
hand."



Good point, but only half the
story.



Apple needs to control the I/O
drivers as much as they need to control the user interface.  One giant headache
in MS world is hardware; specifically, drivers and integration.  Apple doesn't
have this problem because almost everything is
*truly* 
plug and play.  No drivers that I have to deal with; no funny
business.



I just configured my
daughter's brand-new MacBook, and hooked it up to the household Epson R340 with
about 3 clicks in the Print &amp; Fax control panel.  No drivers that I needed
to see.  Clearly, there are printer-specific drivers buried somewhere in OSX. 
But I never saw them or any trace of
them.



"After all these years, is there
finally hope for Apple in the enterprise?"  Actually, Apple's version of
"Enterprise" has numerous advantages.  The level of Apple-supported integrations
means less integration and support by end-users and their IT departments.  Yes,
Apple products are more expensive, but this is only an up-front cost.  If the
TCO is going to be lower, so it is ideal for the
enterprise.



I find the notion that
Apple is depriving "businesses of the flexibility to find the best balance of
hardware, operating system and applications for the job at hand" a little off
the mark.  In many cases, an enterprise has little or no useful concept of
balancing hardware, OS and application.  Many companies have default purchasing
arrangements like Dell-Windows-Oracle, or IBM-IBM-IBM.  Flexibility isn't
helpful in these cases.



Indeed, the
only time Apple's offerings aren't ideal for the enterprise is when we have the
silly **Tomorrow's Dollars Don't Exist** â„¢ conversation.  That's the
conversation where the manager says the up-front cost is the only thing that
matters, and long-term support costs aren't relevant.  After all, long-term
support is paid for in tomorrow's dollars, and we all know that tomorrow may
never come.
