Here's a novel point of view on open source
software.



'In fact, one of the things
Google likes about open source software is that it facilitates secrecy. "If we
had to go and buy software licenses, or code licenses, based on seats, people
would absolutely know what the Google infrastructure looks like," DiBona says.
"The use of open source software, that's one more way we can control our
destiny."'



Since Google is competing
against Micro$oft, IBM, Sun, Oracle, and most other software vendors, this makes
a lot of sense.



But, does it apply
outside the software realm?  I would think so.  In particular, open source gives
you considerably more control over your destiny than packaged software does.




The amazing amount of money poured
into customizing a "packaged solution" always leaves me breathless.  If the
package required so much rework, why not get the an open-source product, and
customize that?



Indeed, how can you
call it a "package" or a "solution" if you have to customize it
extensively?



In Andrew Conry-Murray's
piece, "Do Small Businesses Fear Open Source" lists a number of concerns,
including support, skills, stability and the potential complexity of building a
working architecture.



Interestingly,
one obvious solution to most of the problems in the article isn't mentioned at
all.  For some reason, no one associates their standard, in-house QA programs
with open source software.  I don't understand the disconnect.  In an otherwise
outstanding article on the concerns and value of open source, QA was never
mentioned once.  



Perhaps I'm missing
something, but wouldn't you subject open source software to the same extensive
functional, integration and performance testing you subject your in-house
software?
