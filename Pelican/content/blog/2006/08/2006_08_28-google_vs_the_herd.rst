My thesis is that CIO's are herd animals, making
purchasing decisions based on the perceived direction of the herd.  They sense
this through `Gartner <http://www.gartner.com/>`_   research reports.  There are many
competitors, but Gartner is the
name-brand.



If Gartner signals a shift
in the herd, then alternatives may become interesting.  How will Google signal
this shift so that the herd can change direction?  Does Google have the kind of
name-brand recognition that CIO's recognize?  Will they be the `Izod <http://www.pvh.com/Brand_Izod.html>`_
of software the way Micro$oft is?



Note
that we're talking about social pressure and name-brand.  We're not talking
about quality or functionality.  We know that quality doesn't matter -- the
evidence is the endless patch cycle for MS products.  We know that functionality
doesn't matter: corporate IT routinely removes, disables or replaces parts of
Windows before configuring a standard PC image.  Clearly, the Micro$oft solution
wasn't precisely what anyone
wanted.



Interestingly, if you ask
someone, they'll tell you that MS desktop software "just works".  As if Linux on
the desktop doesn't work, or Mac OS isn't a desktop operating system.  And after
telling you that MS desktop software works, they'll tell you about the patch
release cycle.



A great rationalization
the
**Salvation** 
argument:  MS "standardized" or "integrated" desktop applications.  I've been
told that before MS, the desktop was a zoo of incompatible file formats and
applications.  I didn't recall that we had profound problems with Word Star and
Visicalc.  I think that this is justification for following the herd, not a real
technical issue.



My favorite rationale
is **The Decision Is Already Made** â„¢:  literally, "we're an all
Micro$oft shop".  This -- effectively -- forbids change or innovation.  Since I
prefer not to work with IIS/ASP/VB/C#, I always ask.  And when I'm given one of
the variations on **The Decision Is Already Made** , I know that we will have a number of
strange problems arising from the exceptions to the rule.  The presence of
exceptions, however, is not permission to think outside the box. 




How will Google break up the herd?  If
MS was our Salvation, why leave it now?  If the Decision is Already Made, how
will they get people to unmake the decision?
