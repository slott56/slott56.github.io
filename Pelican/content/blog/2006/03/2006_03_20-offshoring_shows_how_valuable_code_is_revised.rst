When
we outsource of offshore some coding, what are we saying is
valuable?



We're saying that the net
effect of the installed software has value.  We're saying that no existing
product does what our new software will
do.



We're also saying that the capture
of institutional knowledge isn't very important.   Yes, business analysts
capture the knowledge in words and specifications.  But the code -- the final
result of the programming effort, the delivered software -- is the real captured
knowledge that we're going to commit ourselves to using every
day.



So the knowledge capture is of no
value, therefore we can outsource it. 




Worse, we're saying that the COBOL
language is so valuable that we must perpetuate
it.



**Tools, too.**  We're also saying that the tools and
technologies for programming are an onerous burden on our people.  If the
languages and tools are such a burden, perhaps we're missing
something.



My experiences with
customers who outsource is limited to the "outsource the commodity COBOL"
variety.  Looking at Schrage's article, I finally saw the contradiction.  The
COBOL is burdensome, but we can't eliminate the COBOL.  Since we have to
perpetuate it, we'll have it perpetuated by someone
else.



Why do we have to perpetuate
COBOL programming?  Is it because our programmers only have COBOL as their
principle skill?



**Hold the Phone.**   Let's review this slowly and
carefully.  Here's the problem: It's too expensive to produce COBOL programs. 
Just so we're clear, the issue is the cost of COBOL.  The solution appears to be
"do COBOL more cheaply", not "do something else that is inherently cheaper." 
Why the focus on doing COBOL
cheaply?



Do we farm out COBOL because
we love the language?  Is it the only tool that works?  That's the hidden
message in the value proposition: that COBOL is essential, and rather than do
anything new or different, we'll locate someone who can make COBOL for us at a
lower price.



And, in case you know
people who are outsourcing Java, you can simply cut and paste "Java" in place of
"COBOL".  The argument is the same:  the code is
*simultaneously* 
of no value
*and* 
critical to success.



**Changing Tacks** .  Why can't we switch to a
higher-powered language?  If I had a language that requires 1/2 the lines of
code of COBOL, it would be 1/2 the price to create and proportionately cheaper
to maintain.  If I could do this without engaging off-shore resources, wouldn't
that cut management overhead?  The institutional knowledge capture (the activity
that really matters) could be handled by a simple, fact-to-face,
user-analyst-programmer team.



Why can't
we do this?  Because even though we hate COBOL -- really we hate the price and
process of building COBOL programs -- COBOL is as essential as death and
tax-law.  It appears to be the result of some kind of dogmatic article of faith:
COBOL is the only language my people
understand.



Or, phrased another way, my
people are too intellectually impaired to do programming other than COBOL.  And,
of course, my people are too expensive to do COBOL programming.   So, we must do
COBOL and we can't do COBOL. 




**Which Language?**   I think the reason we can't abandon
COBOL is that we wouldn't know what to do next.  With a legacy of COBOL, and a
non-technical CIO (or CTO), language choice isn't on the table.  We can slowly
evolve to Java or C#, claiming it as a "strategic" direction for new projects,
meanwhile continuing to build upgrades and extensions to existing software in
COBOL.



Rather than a tidy, small,
AIX/Linux Python application, we have to buy special-purpose tools, write
extensive specifications, send the work offshore, and then complain that it is
late, expensive and relatively
shoddy.



Is Python really better?  If by
"better", we mean cheaper to produce, then Python has many advantages.  First,
it has extensive and sophisticated libraries and frameworks.  Also, the language
is more compact.  For silly demo programs http://www.csis.ul.ie/cobol/examples/Accept/Multiplier.htm, the Python is 1/2 the size of COBOL.  For
serious programs, the Python can be even smaller.  Of course, there are some
things that are very hard to express in COBOL, but are quite simple in
Python.



Yes, Python is new.  Yes, it is
open source.  More importantly, however, it captures corporate knowledge every
bit as well as COBOL, and you can create Python more simply using your existing
on-shore, in-house, skilled
resources.



**What Do You Value?**   If you value the business solution,
then existing products and open source will usually solve your problem faster
and more cheaply than offshoring the development of new software.  However, you
may have something unique that requires unique
software.



Since you are creating new
software, you value capturing corporate knowledge.  If this isn't true, then you
are creating software as a hobby, and offshoring your hobby makes no sense at
all.  



Since you value capturing
corporate knowledge, then you have to value the process of capturing and the
people who are doing the capture.  It only makes sense to give them powerful
tools that capture knowledge in a compact and usable form.
