A comment on `Offshoring Shows How Valuable Code Is <{filename}/blog/2006/03/2006_03_20-making_pdfs_with_and_without_xsl_fo_revised.rst>`_ floored me: "Another answer [to the 'what
do you value?' question] could be to show cost reduction for the quarter. Its
the old short term thinking to make Wall Street
happy."



First, I concluded that "cost
reduction" is somehow separate from "offshoring production of COBOL".  Which
confuses me, because I thought cost reduction was the driving force behind
offshoring the production of COBOL.  That can't be right, because the comment
reinforces the premise, but is worded as though it
disagrees.



Let's assume the comment is
challenging my conclusion (code captures corporate knowledge, and should be
treated as something of value).   In which case, the comment means that it's
possible that short term cost containment is **more** valuable than the knowledge capture.
Okay.  That's what everyone who is using
cheap off-shore development resources is already saying. 




It appears that the comment is the
same as my statement "So the knowledge capture is of no value, therefore we can
outsource it."  Which was the point I was trying to refute, but didn't do a good
enough job of stating the contradiction.  I'll try
again.



My claim is the
following:



**Knowledge capture has value, that's why we're producing code in the first place.   We produce code (COBOL, Java, doesn't matter which) to capture knowledge.** 



Contradicting this is
the following:



**Knowledge capture is so expensive, we outsource it so that we only partially capture the knowledge.  Indeed, we hand considerable knowledge to our vendors.** 



Hopefully, this -- by
itself -- shows that claiming "short term thinking to make Wall Street happy"
involves a basic contradiction.  A business will both value producing code and
hate the cost of producing code.   It will value the code and simultaneously
treat it as a liability -- a cost to be
reduced.



I'll try my conclusion again,
also.  I suggest we pick one.  Either value code, and do it well, or stop
producing code and start downloading open source and buying
packages.
