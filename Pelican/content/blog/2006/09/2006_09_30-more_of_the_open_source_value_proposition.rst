Binstock does a quick compare and contrast
between Ruby and NetRexx, showing how an active community promoted Ruby, and
NetRexx's lack of a community left it languishing.  I think that this analysis
is only partly true, and misses part of the value of open
source.



Specifically, IBM's proprietary
NetRexx can't be extended, revised, tweaked or improved.  It isn't the
scripting, *per se* , that the community of users value.  It's
the ability to tweak the basic language and interpreter that is so
valuable.



My theory is that the
"serious" (growing, enthused, proselytizing) community springs up when people
have a stake in the language (or interpreter or tool) itself.  In the case of
Python, the most serious advocation seems to follow from the language evolution:
the community improves an idea into a good idea; advocacy makes it a great idea;
enthusiastic support makes it part of the language (or libraries).  And -- in
the case of Python -- you have to convince the BDFL, Guido, that it's totally
Pythonic as well as a great
idea.



Scripts themselves aren't the
ticket.  If the NetRexx interpreter was open source, then people would fix the
bumps and warts that they discovered while writing scripts.  For example, the
classic Python division operator had some serious problems in certain kinds of
numeric programming contexts.  It takes considerable exploration of alternatives
to propose an improvement that preserves simplicity, but adds a distinguishing
feature.  If you don't have open source, you can't -- effectively -- explore the
alternatives.



The source for the tool
(or language) is the ticket.  Once you have the source, you can add, change and
delete features.  If your changes are an improvement -- and you can prove it by
using them -- then you have a compelling argument for your ideas.  If, on the
other hand, your changes are a paper-and-pencil exercise, they don't have any
more merit than the insulated development team's pet project.  Indeed, an
isolated development team has a queue of bug-fixes and enhancement requests, a
microscopic budget, and little real input except from schedule-obsessed
managers.



Dynamic scripting languages
aren't successful because of the community-driven scripting.  They're successful
because of community-driven language evolution, fueled by the needs of the
community-driven scripting.
