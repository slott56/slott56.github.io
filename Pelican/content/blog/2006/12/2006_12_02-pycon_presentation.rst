I'm very excited to be giving a presentation at
PyCon '07.   A 30-minute slot is tough because the Star Schema can be confusing.
The coding is pretty transparent (IMO), but the background for why I had to do
this and places where it can be used are more interesting than the code itself. 
However, it's about Python -- really -- not dimensional modeling design
patterns, so that helps to narrow the
focus.



Decades ago, my employer had an
annual technical conference, and I presented papers every year on a variety of
subjects.   But that was relatively easy: the conference was open to any topic,
and the pool of potential presenters was very small.  I was one of a few dozen
employees that took the time to create a suitable
presentation.



This is different.  The
pool is potentially much larger, the levels of expertise are much higher.  I
know that I'm a good speaker because I get invited back to speak again by people
who've heard me.  However, the technical depth a PyCon is
intimidating.



I work for a services
firm.  Some of our customers are starting to smell the advantages of adopting
Open Source solutions.  At this point, our primary market is Large IT, with some
penetration into "SMB" (Small to Medium Businesses).  No one with revenues under
$2B can afford to talk to us for long.  These organizations tend to be dominated
by the Microsoft FUD message.  Older companies have grown out of the IBM FUD
message and embraced the new MS-FUD V3.0.  Open Source solutions are,
consequently, tainted.



I'm hoping to
learn about Open Source adoption.  In particular, I'm looking a products which
my company should start learning about so that we can adopt the "Red Hat
Business Model" and offer support and customization.  If we identified only one
or two Open Source projects, made significant contributions, and landed support,
integration or customization work because of our support, that would give us a
first step down the road of a business model that has dramatic growth potential.
