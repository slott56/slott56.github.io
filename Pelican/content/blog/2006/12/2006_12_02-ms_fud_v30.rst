MS-FUD 2.0 was "there are no other desktop OS's,
so shut up and pay."  This was supported by the cheerful and helpful advice "If
you don't think we have a monopoly, try and find another desktop OS for all
those Intel processors you've purchased."  This started when Windows 3.0 started
to kill of the old "xx-DOS" variants.  It ended November 16th with `Ballmer's
announcement <http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9005171&source=NLT_AM&nlid=1>`_   about SUSE.




MS-FUD 1.0 was "we wrote all those
xx-DOS's anyway," don't bother with anyone else.
