| Nothing is funnier than requirements which state things that are
  **not** to happen.
| An actual quote.

   ... don't screw up cutting and pasting and the "/" vs "\\" depending
   on unix / windows.

| Why not list everything that's **not** supposed to happen?

-  No fire in the server room.
-  No anthrax outbreak.
-  No Zombie apocalypse.

| 
| The list could go on. I wonder why it doesn't.
