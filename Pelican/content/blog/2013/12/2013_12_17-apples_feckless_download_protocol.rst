For those of us who live mostly off the grid, with inconsistent WiFi
through hosts that flake out frequently, Apple's AppStore download
protocol is absolutely infuriating. It's the most brittle damn protocol
I've ever seen.
When there's any disruption, it simply discards the data it has and
starts again.
How stupid. How blatantly and infuriatingly stupid.
If I pause a download, it will resume. If it breaks, it will not resume.
WTF?
For some things, I can use BitTorrent, which tolerates noisy links. But
for proper AppStore Apps, their protocol is the pits.
Anyone know anyone at Apple who's able to work on a solution to this?
