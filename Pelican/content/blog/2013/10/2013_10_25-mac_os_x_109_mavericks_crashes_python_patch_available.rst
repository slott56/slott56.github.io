I upgraded to Mac OS X 10.9 "Mavericks" today.


Python 3.2.4 crashed in odd places. Not all the time. But help()
stopped working to give one example.


I upgraded to Python 3.3 (it's about time to do that, anyway.)


It crashed, also. Similar places.


Here's the workaround: http://bugs.python.org/issue18458


There's a script which you can download and run. This will tweak your
installations until the next maintenance release of Python.


Whew. That was close.


Now I need to square away setuptools and "easy_install-3.3" all the
missing pieces of my 3.2 environment.
