This: `Python Displacing R As The Programming Language For Data Science <http://readwrite.com/2013/11/25/python-displacing-r-as-the-programming-language-for-data-science#awesm=~ooD70i8bDQn1Dp>`__.

Recently, I've had a former colleague asking questions about Data
Science. See `Obstinate Idiocy <{filename}/blog/2013/06/2013_06_06-obstinate_idiocy_updated.rst>`__
They -- weirdly -- insisted that the only language that made sense to
them was Excel.

My response was a blunt "What?"

The Python vs. R post cited above clarifies that reasons why a
programming language is a better choice than a "tool" or "platform".
