Finally upgraded to Python 3.3.3. The ordinary maintenance release fixed
the problem with the previous release.
The previously documented patch
(http://slott-softwarearchitect.blogspot.com/2013/10/mac-os-x-109-mavericks-crashes-python.html)
is no longer required.
Time to start incrementally installing all the various add-on
components: docutils, PyYaml, Django, Jinja2, SQLAlchemy, etc.
Also, time to put more focus into rewriting various projects to finally
cut the cord with Python2. At this point, there's no longer a reason to
be looking backwards.
