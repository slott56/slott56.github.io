Finally upgraded to Python 3.3.3. The ordinary maintenance release fixed
the problem with the previous release.

The previously documented patch
({filename}/blog/2013/10/2013_10_25-mac_os_x_109_mavericks_crashes_python_patch_available.rst)
is no longer required.

Time to start incrementally installing all the various add-on
components: docutils, PyYaml, Django, Jinja2, SQLAlchemy, etc.

Also, time to put more focus into rewriting various projects to finally
cut the cord with Python2. At this point, there's no longer a reason to
be looking backwards.
