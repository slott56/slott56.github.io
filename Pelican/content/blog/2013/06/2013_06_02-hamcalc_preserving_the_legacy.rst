Wow.
The response to modernizing HamCalc was overwhelming.
Apparently there are a fair number of people who also think that HamCalc
is a treasure to be preserved, improved and added-to.
If you're interested, start here: http://hamcalc.wikispaces.com/home
You can ask to be a member of this wiki, and I can add you. This gives
us a place to share ideas.
I think the most important aspect of this project is to be welcoming and
supportive of recreational and amateur programmers. The explanatory
notes and documentation need to be clear, with proper references and
footnotes. The final application programs need to be simple.
The point of HamCalc is not to build a large, complex application. The
point of HamCalc is to be a repository of small, simple solutions that
can be easily understood and repackaged. In my estimation, no one simply
"uses" HamCalc. They read, extend, modify and make local copies of their
private extensions to HamCalc.
Toward this end, we need to allow for alternate implementations. Two
people should be able to carve out the same piece of code and provide
different implementations that provide consistent results but reflect
different optimizations for speed and resource use.
Here's the code repository. https://github.com/slott56/HamCalc-2.1
This will let folks who are interested get started. What I think might
happen is that people will carve out pieces that interest them and
convert bits of HamCalc. There are 449 programs, each one of which is a
potential nugget of goodness.
