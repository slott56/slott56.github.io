See `The Question of
Risk <http://www.itmaybeahack.com/homepage/iblog/C1076854706/E20070106101634.html>`__.


Also, see `Lean Projects -- Not Deficient
Projects <http://www.itmaybeahack.com/homepage/iblog/C412398194/E20080902155944.html>`__.


And `Keeping the Customer
Satisfied <http://www.itmaybeahack.com/homepage/iblog/C1076854706/E20080514185337.html>`__.


These are notes for a long, detailed rant on the value of Agile
methods.


One specious argument against an Agile approach is the "risk
management" question. In this case, however, it becomes a "how much
of a contingency budget should be write into the contract." Which
isn't really risk management.
