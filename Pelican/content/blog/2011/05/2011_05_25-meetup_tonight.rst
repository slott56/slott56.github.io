Tonight (May 25th). Red Dog. Colley Ave. Ghent. I'll be wearing my Stack
Overflow shirt. I'll be there about 7. I know that at least one other
person won't be there until 8.

The
`Meetup <http://www.meetup.com/stackoverflow/Hampton-VA/105118/>`__
link.

I like this meetup idea a lot. Probably because the WFH
life-style is a little isolating.

There's the small "`Hampton Stack Overflow
Community <http://www.meetup.com/stackoverflow/Hampton-VA/>`__".
We have a common interest in Stack Overflow.

Also, there's the `757 Python Users
Group <http://www.meetup.com/757-Python-Users-Group/>`__. We have
a common interest in Python. I've decided to become the "official"
organizer for this. I'm going to join the `757
Labs <http://757labs.org/>`__ Hackerspace, also.
