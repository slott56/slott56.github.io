This is a fair-to-partly silly question that shows up on places like
StackOverflow once in a while.

Python is used widely and pretty heavily.

It's a built-in feature to many operating systems in common use. The
exception, of course, is Windows.

I just found out -- the hard way -- that Python 2.6 is an integral
part of `Apple's iLife <http://www.apple.com/ilife/>`__ suite of
products.

Important safety tip for Mac OS X users. System.Libary.Frameworks
should not be touched.

Also, it helps to get used to the idea of typing python3 on the
command-line. Further, it helps to skip Python 3.1 and go straight to
Python 3.2.

Python 3.2 has
`argparse <http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/argparse.html>`__ and
the new dictionary-based configuration of
`logging <http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/logging.config.html#logging.config.dictConfig>`__.

I worked on a PyQT interface to a database with a Python API used by
thousands of engineers around the world working on a large new
commercial airliner. I won't say where I worked but Airbus and Boeing
are the only two players in the large commrcial airliner market. :)


Why do you recommend skipping Python 3.1?

Sometimes I feel like Python is like COBOL in that it is "Everywhere and
Nowhere."
One thing that I like about Python is that it is being used for about
everything that one could use a programming language to do.
But somehow, despite this, I don't know anyone that gets paid to program
in Python. Even when I go to the the local Python user group, I mainly
meet people that spend their days programming in Java, C#, or even Ruby.
Anyway, all of this is to agree with your assessment, that the question
is partly fair, and partly silly.
