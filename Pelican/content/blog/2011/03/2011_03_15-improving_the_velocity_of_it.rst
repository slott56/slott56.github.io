Check this out: "`IT Is Too Darn
Slow <http://www.informationweek.com/news/global-cio/interviews/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=229218781>`__".

This article is packed with helpful advice on how to improve
"velocity" and the pace of innovation.

Good quotes: "Once IT decides to focus on speed, two obstacles get in
the way: security and governance." This is important. Manage security
without it becoming an impediment.

One of the most important things not mentioned here is the idea that
internal security must be a simple, cheap commodity. A identity
manager and SSO framework needs to be standard, available, and
well-understood. Each project shouldn't involve head-scratching and
deep thinking about security. Like an OS and a file system, security
infrastructure should be a given.

Another good quote: "IT can't set priorities for 10 projects spread
over the next two years because, once projects one, two, and three
are done, that will change what would have been four, five, and six."

What isn't provided is the a way to handle the accounting practices
that always seem to take IT hostage. The idea of "capital" vs.
"expense" can serve as a weird artificial boundary on innovative
projects. Lots of innovation gets chopped off when the "capital"
budget is spent, and we switch over to "expense" where we can't
invent anything new. It's the same people. Yet, the money is
"different".
