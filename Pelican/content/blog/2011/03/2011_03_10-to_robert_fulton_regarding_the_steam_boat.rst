A quote

    "What sir, would you make a ship sail against the wind and currents
    by lighting a bonfire under her deck? I pray you excuse me. I have no
    time to listen to such nonsense."

    -- Napoleon Bonaparte

There's no authoritative source for this quote. Since Fulton was
commissioned to build a submarine and did build a steam-powered boat
in France, it's unlikely for this quote to be actually true.
