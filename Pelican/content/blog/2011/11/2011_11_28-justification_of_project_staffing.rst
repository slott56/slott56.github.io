I really dislike being asked to plan a project.  It's hard to predict
the future accurately.

In spite of the future being -- well -- the future, and utterly
unknowable, we still have to have the following kinds of discussions.

Me: "It's probably going to take a team of six."

Customer: "We don't really have the budget for that.  You're going to
have to provide a lot of justification for a team that big."

What's wrong with this picture?  Let's enumerate.

#. Customer is paying me for my opinion based on my experience.  If they
   want to provide me with the answers, I have a way to save them a lot
   of money.  Write their own project plan with their own answers and
   leave me out of it.

#. I've already provided all the justification there is.  I'm predicting
   the future here.  Software projects are not simple Rate-Time-Distance
   fourth-grade math problems.  They involve an unknown number of
   unknowns.  I can't provide a "lot" of justification because there
   isn't any indisputable basis for the prediction.

#. I don't know the people. The customer -- typically -- hasn't hired
   them yet.  Since I don't know them, I don't know how "productive"
   they'll be.  They could hire a dozen n00bz who can't find their asses
   blindfolded even using both hands.  Or.  They could hire two singular
   geniuses who can knock the thing out in a weekend.  Or.  They could
   hire a half-dozen arrogant SOB's who refuse to follow my
   recommendations.

#. They're going to do whatever they want no matter what I say.
   Seriously.  I could say "six".  They could argue that I should
   rewrite the plan to say "four" without changing the effort and
   duration.  Why ask me to change the plan?  A customer can only do
   what they **know** to be the right thing.

**Doing the Right Thing**

Let's return to that last point.  A customer project manager can only
do what they absolutely **know** is the right thing.  I can suggest
all kinds of things.  If they're too new, too different, too
disturbing, they're going to get ignored.

Indeed, since people have such a huge `Confirmation
Bias <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias>`__, it's very,
very hard to introduce anything new.  A customer doesn't bring in
consultants without having already sold the idea that a software
development project is in the offing.  They justify spending a few
thousand on consulting by establishing some overall, ball-park,
big-picture budget and showing that the consulting fees are just a
small fraction of the overall.

As consultants, we have to guess this overall, ball-park, big-picture
budget accurately, or the project will be shut down.  If we guess too
high, then the budget is out of control, or the scope isn't
well-enough defined, or some other smell will stop all progress.  If
we guess too low, then we have to lard on additional work to get back
to the original concept.

Architectures, components and techniques **all** have to meet
expectations. A customer that isn't familiar with test drive
development, for example, will have an endless supply of objections.
"It's unproven."  "We don't have the budget for all that testing."
"We're more comfortable with our existing process."

The final trump card is the passive aggressive "I'll have to see the
detailed justification."  It means "Don't you dare."  But it sounds
just like passive acceptance.

Since project managers can only do what they know is right, they'll
find lots of ways of subverting the new and unfamiliar.

If they don't like the architecture, the first glitch or delay or
problem will immediately lead to a change in direction to yank out the
new and replace it with the familiar.

If they don't like a component, they'll find numerous great reasons to
rework that part of the project to remove the offending component.

If they don't like a technique (e.g., Code Walk Throughs) they'll
subvert it.  Either not schedule them.  Or cancel them because there
are "more important things to do."  Or interrupt them to pull people
out of them.

**Overcoming the Confirmation Bias**

I find the process of overcoming the confirmation bias to be tedious.
Some people like the one-on-one "influencing" role.  It takes patience
and time to overcome the confirmation bias so that the customer is
open to new ideas.  I just don't have the patience.  It's too much
work to listen patiently to all the objections and slowly work through
all the alternatives.

I've worked with folks who really relish this kind of thing.  Endless
one-on-one meetings.  Lots of pre-meetings and post-meetings and
reviews of drafts.  I suppose it's rewarding.  Sigh.

"Doing the Right Thing"
Is this a religious activity? Must we summon a priest, rabbi or some
such thing? Must we convert someone to our "religion" so that they do
the "right thing".
Perhaps the initial mindset is all wrong? Perhaps we should be "making
business decisions" instead?
Recently, one group at the client wanted to do x because it was the
"right things to do". Another group wanted to do y because it was the
"right thing to do? From perspective a, x was the right thing to do.
From perspective b, y was the right thing to do. I was caught in the
middle and got annoyed. I finally said, it is a business decision that
must be centered around time to market.
Perhaps the budget trumps all? Okay, let be honest about that.
Perhaps orgs is not willing to change process d? Okay, lets be honest
about that.
