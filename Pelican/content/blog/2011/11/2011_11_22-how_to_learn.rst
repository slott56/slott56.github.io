A recent question.

    i came up with two options.

    1.  building skills 1 (+ other references)... then algorithms & data
    structures.... then your books 2 & 3

    or

    2.  your three books 1,2 & 3... then algo & ds
    kindly help me decide so i can start soon.




I have two pieces of advice.

First.  Programming is a *language* skill.  Just like English.  If you
can't get the English right, the odds of getting Python, Java, HTML or
SQL right is considerably reduced.  Please, please, please take more
care in grammar, syntax and punctuation.  Otherwise, your future as a
programmer doesn't look very good.  For example, the personal pronoun
is spelled "I".  In the 20th century, we spell out "and"; we stopped
writing "&" as a stand-in for the Latin "*et*" centuries ago.  Also,
ellipses ("...") shouldn't be used except when eliding part of a
quote.  Clarity and precision actually matter.

Second, and more relevant, your two choices don't really amount to a
significant difference.  If you're waiting around for advice, you're
wasting your time.  Both sequences are good ideas. It's more important
to get started than it is to carefully choose the precise and exact
course of study. Just start doing something immediately.

Learning to program is a life-long exercise. There will **always** be
more to learn. Start as soon as you can. The exact choices don't
matter.  Why?  Because, eventually, you'll read **all** of those books
plus  **many, many** others.

Spend less time waiting for advice and more time studying.
