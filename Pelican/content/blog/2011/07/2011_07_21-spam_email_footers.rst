I don't want the spamilicious email.  I'm trying to actually
unsubscribe.
The footer says "If you are not the intended recipient, you are hereby
notified that any dissemination, distribution or copying of any
information contained in or attached to this communication is strictly
prohibited. If you have received this message in error, please notify
the sender immediately and delete the material from any computer."
I don't feel like the intended recipient because it's just irrelevant
junk.  Perhaps you should not have disseminated, distributed, copied or
sent me this.  Wouldn't that have been simpler? Keep it to yourself?
I also think I've received the message in error.  Since I don't want the
damn thing. And that means that I have to delete it?  Why can't you stop
sending it?  Wouldn't that be simpler for both of us?
