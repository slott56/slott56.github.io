Just saw this for the first time today:  http://cwe.mitre.org/top25/
I'd always relied on
this: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project
Both are really good lists of security vulnerabilities.
I once had to listen to a DBA tell me that "we don't know what we don't
know" as a way of saying that there was no way to be sure that a web app
was "secure".  That comment lead the project manager to go  through the
classic "risk exposure" exercise (and hours of discussion) to determine
that security mattered.  We defined the risks, the costs and the
probability of occurrence so that we could document all kinds of
potential exposures or something.
Instead of hand-wringing, these kinds of simple lists of the common
vulnerabilities provides actionable steps for design, code, test and
audit of operations.  Further, they guide selection, configuration and
operation of web server technology to assure that the vulnerabilities
are addressed.
