See this `Limitations of Agile Software
Development <http://www.pmhut.com/limitations-of-agile-software-development>`__ and
this `The Agile "Religion" --
What? <{filename}/blog/2011/10/2011_10_20-the_agile_religion_what.rst>`__.

What's important is that the limitations of Agile are not
limitations.  They're (mostly) intentional roadblocks to Agile.

Looking for "limitations" in the Agile approach misses the point of
Agile in several important ways.

The most important problem with this list of "limitations" is that
five of the six issues are simply anti-Agile positions that a company
can take.

In addition to being anti-Agile, a company can be anti-Test Driven
Development.  They can be Anti-Continuous Integration.  They can be
Anti-NoSQL.  There are lots of steps a company can take to subvert any
given development practice.  Taking a step against a practice does not
reveal a limitation.

**"1. A team of stars... it takes more than the average Joe to achieve agility"**.   This is not a specific step against agility.  I chalk
this up to a project manager who really likes autocratic rule.  It's
also possible that this is from a project manager that's deeply
misanthropic.  Either way, the underlying assumption is that
developers are somehow too dumb or disorganized to be trusted.

Agile only requires working toward a common goal.  I can't see how a
project manager is an *essential* feature of working toward a common
goal.  A manager may make things more clear or more efficient, but
that's all.  Indeed, the "clarity" issue is emphasized in most Agile
methods: a "Scrum Master" is part of the team specifically to foster
clarity of purpose.

Further, some Agile methods require a Product Owner to clarify the
team's direction.

"A team of stars" is emphatically **not** required.  The experience of
folks working in Agile environments confirms this.  Real, working
Agile teams really really are average.

**"2. Fit with organizational culture"**.  This has nothing to do with
Agile methods.  This is just a sweeping (and true) generalization
about organizations.  An organization that refuses autonomy and
refuses flexibility can't use Agile methods.  An organization that
refuses to create a "Big Design Up Front" can't use a traditional
waterfall method and **must** use Agile methods.

Organizational fit is not a limitation of Agile.  It's just a fact
about people.

**"3. Small team...Assuming that large projects tend to require large teams, this restriction naturally extends to project size."**

The assumption simply contradicts Agile principles.  It's not a
"limitation" at all.  Large projects (with large numbers of people)
have a number of smaller teams.  I've seen projects with over a dozen
parallel Agile teams.  This means that in addition to a dozen daily
scrums, there's also a scrum-of-scrums by the scrum masters.

Throwing out the small team isn't a limitation of Agile.  It's a
failure to understand Agile.  A project with many small teams works
quite well.  It's not "religion".  It's experience.

A single large team has been shown (for the last few decades) to be
expensive and risky.

**"4. Collocated team...We can easily think of a number of situations where this limitation prevents using agile:"**  These are not
limitations of Agile, but outright refusals to follow Agile
principles.  Specifically:

-   "**Office space organized by departments**" is not a limitation of
    Agile.  That's a symptom of an organization that refuses to be Agile.
    See #2 above; this indicates a bad fit with the culture.  An
    organization that doesn't have space organized by department might
    have trouble executing a traditional waterfall method.

-   "**Distributed environment**" is not a limitation of Agile.  Phones
    work.  Skype works.

-   "**Subcontracting... We have to acknowledge that there is no
    substitute for face-to-face**".  Actually, subcontracting is
    irrelevant.  Further, subcontracting is not a synonym for a failure
    to be collocated.  When subcontractors are located remotely, phones
    still work.  Skype works better and is cheaper.

**"5. Where’s my methodology?"**  This is hard to sort out, since
it's full of errors.  Essentially, this appears to be a claim that a
well-defined, documented processes is somehow *essential* to software
development.  Experience over the last few decades is quite clear
that the written processes and the work actually performed diverge a
great deal.  Most of the time, what people do is not documented, and
the documented process has no bearing on what people actually do.  A
documented process -- in most cases -- appears irrelevant to the work
actually done.

Agile is not chaos.  It's a change in the rules to de-emphasize
unthinking adherence to a plan and replace this with focus on working
software.  Well-organized software analysis, design, code and test
still exist even without elaborately documented (and irrelevant)
process definitions.

"**6. Team ownership vs. individual accountability... how can we implement it since an organization’s performance-reward system assesses individual performance and rewards individuals, not teams...?**"
Again, the assumption ("performance-reward system
assesses individual performance") is simply a rejection of Agile
principles.  It's not a limitation of Agile, it's an intentional step
away from an Agile approach.

If an organization insists on individual performance metrics, see #2.
The culture is simply antithetical to Agile. Agile still works; the
organization, however, is taking active steps to subvert it.

Agile isn't a religion.  It doesn't suffer from hidden or ignored
"limitations".

**"But did we question the assumption that Agile was indeed superior to traditional methodologies?"**

The answer is "yes".  A thousand times yes.  The whole reason for
Agile approaches is specifically and entirely because of folks
questioning traditional methodologies.  Traditional
command-and-control methodologies have a long history of not working
out well for software development.  The Agile Manifesto is a result
of examining the failures of traditional methods.

A traditional "waterfall" methodology works when there are few
unknowns.  Construction projects, for example, rarely have the kinds
of unknowns that software development has.  Construction usually
involves well-known techniques applied to well-documented plans to
produce a well-understood result.  Software development rarely
involves so many well-known details.  Software development is 80%
design and 20% construction.  And the design part involves 80%
learning something new and 20% applying experience.

Agile is not Snake Oil.  It's not something to be taken on faith.

The Agile community exists for exactly one reason.  Agile methods
work.

Agile isn't a money-making product or service offering.  Agile --
itself -- is free.  Some folks try to leverage Agile techniques to
sell supporting products or services, but Agile isn't an IBM or
Oracle product.  There are no "backers".  There's no trail of money
to see who profits from Agility.

Folks have been questioning "traditional" methodologies for years.
Why?  Because "traditional" waterfall methodologies are a
crap-shoot.  Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't work.  The
essential features of long term success are summarized in the `Agile
Manifesto <http://agilemanifesto.org/>`__.  Well-run projects all
seem to have certain common features; the features of well-run
projects form the basis for the Agile methods.

>(mostly) intentional roadblock
Personally I prefer words like "administering the are you serious test"?
Recently, a client was jumping up and down that they wanted x. I
requested that they do x to further their goal. It took them over 6 days
to do x. When I pointed this out they were furious were furious but they
go the point.

Hi, probably our entry may be off topic but anyways, I have been surfing
around your blog and it looks
very professional. It’s obvious you know your topic and you appear
fervent about it. I’m developing a
fresh blog plus I’m struggling to make it look good, as well as offer
the best quality content. I have
learned much at your web site and also I anticipate alot more articles
and will be coming back soon.
Thanks you.
