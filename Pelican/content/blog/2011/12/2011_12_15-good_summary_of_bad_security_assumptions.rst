This isn't the `OWASP Top

list, but it's still very handy.
`Top 10 Dumb Computer Security
Notions <http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/Top-10-Dumb-Computer-Security-Notions-and-Myths-740587/>`__.
I'm particularly fond of the "security can't be perfect; since it can't
be perfect, why bother?" approach.
One other notion that amuses me is the silliness of changing a password
every 90 days.  The argument is that "it's harder to hit a moving
target".  That's obviously false.  A good rainbow table and a bad
password without salt can be broken in about half an hour.  There's no
"moving target" here.  At 30 minutes to crack a password, the only way
the target can appear to move is making every password a 1-time-only
password based on some kind of external source (like a token generator.)
