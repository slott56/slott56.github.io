Wow.  Just wow.  See "`LANGSEC explained in a few
slogans <http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~sergey/langsec/occupy/>`__".
Short, easy-to-grasp explanation of why complex protocols create new
problems.
I'm happy with REST and the stack of stuff under it (HTTP, TCP/IP, etc.)
Once upon a time (2001), I invented by own version of a RESTful protocol
outside HTTP.  That was cool.  Very simple, and very fast.  But
relatively inflexible.  The syntax was more like FTP and SMTP; the
semantics where mostly just CRUD rules and RESTful state transfers.
I was way too dumb to leverage HTTP methods and the genius of a URI.
