Read this first: "`There is something I find interesting about online
discussions around performance
issues <http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2375750>`__..." It's about
Stack Overflow, specifically. Apparently, someone didn't get their
question answered and decided it was better to gripe than to rewrite the
question.

Let's look at their response in pieces.

"people try to gang up". Since there's almost no social networking
capability, this is a bit much to attribute to people responding to a
poorly-worded question. But, if you've worked all day on a bad
solution to a poorly-conceived problem, it can *feel* like being
ganged up on. When reality leaks in, it can feel unpleasant.

Hint 1. There are no gangs. It's possible that the question really is
poorly written.

"cookie-cutter, patronizing, zero-information responses". I'm
guessing these are comments suggesting the approach is bad and asking
for clarification. I run afoul of this often because I feel compelled
to post comments asking for clarification. Some folks just don't like
to clarify. More than once I've been told that their question was
very clear. Since I'm asking for clarification, it seems odd to
insist the question is perfect. Worse, of course, is asking for help
on Stack Overflow, but refusing to clarify the help required.

Hint 2. Clarify. Please. Don't insist that the question is perfect.

"they assume, without any basis, that the person has not (a)
benchmarked the code," When the question has no bench mark data, this
isn't an assumption. It's a response to the lack of benchmark data.

Hint 3. Provide the facts. Don't complain when folks ask for facts.

"(b) is obviously running an inferior algorithm". Again, this isn't
an assumption. It's the response to an incomplete question where the
algorithm isn't provided. Also, it's a common response to questions
where the algorithm really is inferior.

Hint 4. Consider that -- even after spending days banging your head
against the wall -- your question might be poorly-written and require
both benchmark data and an algorithm.

"advice about premature optimization... is a well assimilated
folklore by now and I dont see how repeating that adds value".
Without measurements, profiler results and benchmark data, this is
our only possible response. *After* the profiler results are posted,
this advice really is useless. *Before* profiler results are posted,
this advice often turns out to be essential.

Hint 5. Whatever you might know is not well-assimilated folklore on
Stack Overflow as a whole. We don't know you, sadly. We don't know
how much you know. To avoid useless advice, provide evidence -- in
the question -- that the advice has *already* been followed.

"better served if the discussion shifted to ... Pointed out possible
bottlenecks ahead of time," Wouldn't that be nice? What's a "possible
bottleneck"? It's a badly-design algorithm. So, the responses to
performance questions has to be focused on algorithm choice right
away. That means details on the code being used, and profiling
information.

Hint 6. There is no hint 6. This would simply repeat hints 3 and 5.

"regardless of the fact whether the code construct is actually a
bottleneck in the application or not, it is always good to know what
the more efficient alternatives are... there is something called
intellectual curiosity."

Reducing a question to a hand-waving hypothetical doesn't *improve*
the question. It doesn't *rationalize* a poor question. The question
still needs to be clarified.

Hint 7. If the question raises a lot of comments and useless advice,
please **rewrite** the question.
