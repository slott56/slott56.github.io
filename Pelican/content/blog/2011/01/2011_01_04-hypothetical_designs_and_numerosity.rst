I love hypothetical questions. Got a bunch recently. I guess it's the
season for hypotheticals.

These all seem to come from the "Averted Glance" school of
management. The best part about the "I don't want to know the
details" management is that we need to substitute metrics for
understanding. One could also call this the "Numerosity" school of
management. It's one step above numerology.

There is no substitute for hands-on work. Quantity leads directly to
Quality. Bottom Line: **touch the technology early and often**.

**Easier**

I described the Sphinx production pipeline as "easier" than
DocBook.

Someone asked for a definition of "easier". I had to research the
definition of "easier" and found the Standard Information
Management Process and Logical Effort index (SIMPLE). This index
has a number of objective scoring factors for platform, language,
toolset, performance, steps, problems encountered, rework and
workaround, as well as the price to tea in China.

I find the SIMPLE index to be very useful for answering the random
questions that arise when someone does not want to actually
besmirch their fingers by touching the technology.

Considering that Sphinx and the DocBook processing components are
both largely free, it seemed easier to me to actually rig them up
and run them a few times to see how they work. But that relies on
the undefined term "easier". To cut the Gordian Knot while keeping
the eyes averted, one resorts to numerosity.

**Cleaner and More Uniform**

I described XML as cleaner and more uniform than LaTeX. (Even
though I've switched to LaTeX because it produces better results.)

Someone asked for a definition of Cleaner and More Uniform. I
tried using the `Flesch-Kincaid Readability
Index <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_test>`__,
but it was limited to the content and didn't work well for the
markup. I tried using this
`calculator <http://www.standards-schmandards.com/exhibits/rix/>`__,
but it barfed. So I invented by own index based on the `Halstead
complexity
metrics <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halstead_complexity_measures>`__.

I find the Halstead complexity to be very useful for answering
random questions that arise when someone does not want to actually
burden themselves with looking at the technology. I suppose actual
examples of XML vs. LaTex vs. RST would burn holes in the brain,
running the risk of killing one of the few working brain cells.

**Inheritance vs. Delegation**

My favorite, however, is the question on "criteria for when to use
/ not use inheritance". Asking for criteria is the leading
indicator of the Numerosity School of Design. How do I know this?

No Example.

Hypothetical questions never have practical class definitions.
They either have no classes at all, or an overly simplified design
based on Foo, Bar and Baz. Rather than actually write some code,
we'll talk about what might go into writing some code.

The most important part of learning OO design is to actually do a
lot of OO design. `Code

works. `Quantity translates directly to
Quality <http://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2007/02/quantity_equals.html>`__.

Don't talk about writing code. Write code. Write lots of code.
Write as much code as possible.

I'm revising my Building Skills in OO Design book to make it a
better answer to the Inheritance vs. Delegation question. Do the
exercises. At the end of the book, you'll know the answers.

**Sadly**

Sadly, the bulk of IT management does not believe in
skill-building. Training is limited to one or two weeks out of 52
(just under 2% of your working life) and that's as often cancelled
as granted. Any time spent trying something to see if it will work
is aggressively punished ("Quit gold plating that solution and put
some garbage into production right now! Learn on your own time.
King Cnut Demands It.")
