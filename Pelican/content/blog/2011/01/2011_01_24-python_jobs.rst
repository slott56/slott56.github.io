Looked interesting enough for someone to email it to me. Still can't
figure out why they sent it. Posting this feels like advertising, so
perhaps I should charge them a promotional fee.

**Web Services - Mobile Developer**

    established Python-based framework (Django or Pylons).

    Demonstrated proficiency with Python is a must."

Maybe they sent it as confirmation that Python is somehow a "real"
technology.
