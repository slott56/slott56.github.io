I'm looking for a unbiased Python expert to help with a book I'm working
on. We need "an unbiased python expert with a keen eye for detail."

The role is technical reviewer. I've never done this before, but it
appears that the tech reviewer is a paid position somewhere in a
publication pipeline along with copy editing and other production
steps. It doesn't sound like a full-time job, since the chapters
trickle through the pipeline slowly.

I'm guessing that you'd get to correct the misstatements and run all
the code examples.
