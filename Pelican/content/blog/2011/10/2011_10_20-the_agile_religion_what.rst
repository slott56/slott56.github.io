    "it seems that software development has caught the agile
    religion. Personally, I have an issue w/ being unimodal."

What?

First.  "agile religion".  As in the deprecating statement: *Agile is
nothing more than a religion*?  As in *Agile is nothing more than a
vague religious practice with no tangible value to an organization*?
Interesting, I guess.

I'm assuming that the author did not read the `Manifesto for Agile
Software Development <http://agilemanifesto.org/>`__.  Or--worse-- they
read it and find that the four values (Individuals and
interactions, Working software, Customer collaboration and Responding to
change) are just of no tangible value.

That's alarming.  Really.  The alternative (processes and
tools, comprehensive documentation, contract negotiation, and following
a plan without regard to changes) seems like it's a recipe for cost,
risk, low-value work and a cancelled project.  Indeed, it seems like
non-Agile project management is the best way to get to the fabled
"Software Crisis" where lots of money gets spent but little of value
gets created.

Further, it seems that **all** modifications of the classic waterfall
method (e.g., spiral method as a prime example) specifically create
"iterative, incremental" approaches to software development.  That is,
everything that's not a strict (brain-dead) waterfall has some elements
of Agile.

This causes me to think that Agile isn't a religion.  It causes me to
think that Waterfall methods were a religious practice of no tangible
value.  All the methodology experiments over the last 15 years have been
ways of introducing flexibility (agility, brains) into a foolishly
inflexible methodology definition.

Indeed, it appears that the heavy-weigh waterfallish methods are an
attempt to replace thinking with process.  And it didn't work.  So, we
have to go back to the thinking part.  Only, we call it Agile now.

**Religious Wars**.

Second.  "agile religion" (again).  As in *methodology discussions are
just religious wars*?  As in *methodology discussions are just quibbling
over no-value details*?  Some folks may get this impression of making a
choice between Agile vs. Non-Agile methods.  I think that those folks
haven't actually had the opportunity to work from a prioritized backlog
and build the most valuable part first.  I think that someone who things
Agile is just a religious war hasn't been allowed to fix a broken
project plan based on lessons learned during the first release.

**Agility**.

Third.   "unimodal".  As in *being exclusively Agile is bad*?  As in
*sometimes you need to have a rigid, unyielding process that sticks
strictly to the schedule irrespective of changes which may occur*?  That
doesn't seem rational.

Change happens.  Forcing the inevitable changes to conform to some
farcical schedule made up by people who didn't have all the details
seems silly.  Making contract negotiation the focal point of response to
change seems like a waste of effort.  Trying to document everything so
completely that all possible changes are already accounted for seems
impossible.  And replacing change with a process that regulates change
seems -- perhaps -- unhinged.

There were some links and some charts and graphs attached.  I couldn't
get past the two sentences above to see if there was, perhaps, something
more to it.  All I could do was respond with a request for clarification
that didn't involve the trivialization of Agile methods.  It doesn't
seem sensible to try and remove the human element from software
development.

I'll provide whatever follow-up clarification surfaces on this topic.

It's interesting to see if the "agile religion" was misplaced, or if
there are folks who think that responding to the messiness of real
software development is a bad idea.

We tried the waterfall method.  And it didn't work very well.  Agile
isn't a "religion".  It's a simple acknowledgement that reality is
messy.

The reason, I think, that the strongest proponents of Agile are being
labeled "religious zealots" is because there have been a number of
people who have said that it is better for every project ever when there
was little to no evidence to support that position. At this point, most
main-stream authors are advocating a combination -- one cannot exist by
itself and survive.

The `Network Systems
Engineer <https://www.fieldengineer.com/skills/network-systems-engineer>`__
must document all the interactions with detail technical descriptions,
root causes and solutions. The professionals have to examine and
evaluate the new technology and must brief others about its merits,
weaknesses and recommendation on adoptability. They have to validate the
updates of the operating system, software, hardware.
