The topic of VMware came up at my local `757 Python Users
Group <http://www.meetup.com/757-Python-Users-Group/>`__.

A common administrative need is to control VM farms.  While there are
a number of pointy-clicky GUI tools, VMware offers the VIX library to
permit writing scripts to control VM's.

Here's some information we looked at recently on `PyVIX2 and
VMware <http://www.meetup.com/757-Python-Users-Group/pages/PyVIX2_and_VMware_Control/>`__.

The idea behind PyVIX2 is to provide a relatively simple Python
binding to VIX.    This, too, is a command-line interface, following
on the heels of `More Command-Line
