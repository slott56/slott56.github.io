Just started learning about
"`Hackerspace <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace>`__".
Without really knowing what I was doing, I fell into the `757
Labs <http://757labs.org/>`__ Hackerspace.
The `757 Python Users'
Group <http://www.meetup.com/757-Python-Users-Group/>`__, specifically.
What a great idea.  Bright people.  Interested in the same area of
technology.
It's like hanging around with sailors at a marina.
