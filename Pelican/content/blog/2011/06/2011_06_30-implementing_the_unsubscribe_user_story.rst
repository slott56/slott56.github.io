I've been unsubscribing from some junk email recently.
The user story is simple: As a not-very-interested person, I want to get
off your dumb-ass mailing list so that I don't have to flag your crap as
spam any more.

The implementations vary from good to evil.  Here's what I've found.
The best sites have an unsubscribe link that simply presents the facts
-- you are unsubscribed.  I almost feel like re-subscribing to a site
that handles this use case so well.

The first level of crap is a site which forces me to click an OK or
Unsubscribe button to confirm that I really want to unsubscribe and
wasn't clicking the tiny little links at the end of the message
randomly.

The deeper level of "marketing" crap is a form that allows me to
"configure my subscription settings".  This is done by some marketing
genius who wanted to "offer additional value" rather than simply do what
I asked.  This is a hateful (but not yet evil) practice.  I don't want
to "configure" my settings.  I want out.

The third-from-worst is a form in which I must enter my email address.

What?  I have several email aliases that redirect to a common mailbox.
I have to -- what? -- guess which of the aliases was used?  This is
pernicious because I can make a spelling mistake and they can continue
to send me dunning email.  This fill-in-the-blanks unsubscribe is simply
evil because it gives them plausible deniability when the continue to
send me email.  It's now my fault that I didn't spell my name correctly.
The next-to-worst is a "mailto:" link that jumps into my emailer.  I
have to -- what? -- fill in the magic word "Complete" somewhere?  You're
kidding, right?  This is so 1980's-vintage listserv that I'm hoping
these companies can be sued because they failed to actually unsubscribe
folks.  Again, this gives the spammer a legitimate excuse because I
failed to do the arcane step properly.

The worst is no link at all.  Just instructions explaining that an email
must be send with the magic word "Complete" or "Unsubscribe" in the
subject or body.  Because I use aliases, this will probably not
unsubscribe anything useful, but will only unsubscribe my outbound email
address.  This is the worst kind of evil.  In a way, it meets the user
story.  But only in a very, very oblique way.

Don't forget the final insult: "You may continue to receive email from
us for the next 6-8 weeks..."
By then, of course--much like mailing a rebate--you've forgotten that
you already tried to unsubscribe and either go through the whole cycle
again or just give up.
