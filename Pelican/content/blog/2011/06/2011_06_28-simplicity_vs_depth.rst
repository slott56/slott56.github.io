During  chapter technical reviews, the question of technical depth has
come up time and again.  Essentially, in every single chapter.
In the older `Building Skills in Python <http://homepage.mac.com/s_lott/books/python/html/index.html>`__
book, there are a number of topics that feel "digressive" to the
reviewer and editor.  Too much depth.

However, there are a number of Python tutorials, many of which are very
shallow.  I'd like to find a way to retain the technical depth, without
it feeling "digressive".

Choice 1.
    Split each chapter into different "basic" and "advanced"
    sections.  This would retain a sensible outline of parts (Language
    Fundamentals, Data Structures, Classes, Modules and a bunch of advanced
    projects) and chapters within each part.  Some chapters would still have
    to be split because a number of "advanced" concepts (i.e. alternative
    function argument passing with \* and \*\*) really has to be delayed
    until after an appropriate data structure chapter.

Choice 2.
    Separate material two kinds of chapters "basic" and "pro".
    This would lead to a "basics" thread for n00bz (read all the "basics"
    chapters) and an "pro" thread for professionals where you'd just read
    all the chapters in order without skipping.    This would create some
    more chapters, but each chapter would be shorter and more focused.

If you consider "passing arguments to functions" an advanced concept,
then maybe your problem isn't the depth of the material itself, but what
you consider an advanced skill.

Decision Fatigue
In psychology/marketing, it is well established that if you give humans
too many choices, they make no choice. Readers students want to make the
decision once as to whether or not the book is at the appropriate level
and be done w/ it. They don't want to continually make the decision
should I read or not read this chapter or this section.
The other thing, look at how successful your book is. Look at how widely
it is referenced out there in the internet.

Bottom line question: Who is your intended audience?
In your book you explicitly state
"Audiance: Professional programmers who need to learn Python are our
primary audience."
url:
http://homepage.mac.com/s_lott/books/python/html/preface.html#audience
So, are you going to change your target audience? Is your target
audience everyone? Both basic and pro?
Now that everyone is our target audience, we can then ring our hands
about what belongs in the basic areas of the book and what belongs in
the advanced part of the book.
Lets not stop at adding burdens just to the author, lets make sure to
add burdens to the readers. The reader has to figure out whether or not
to read a section depending on whether it is basic or advanced. Of
course the reader will disagree w/ what is advanced and what is basic
and he then can have endless arguments w/ the author.
How about choice 0: do nothing and stick w/ the original intended
audience?
How many other successful tech language books have both basic and
advanced excepted in an extremely limited sense?
