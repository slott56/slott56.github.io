It's not TWIKI or one of those really
easy-to-use Wiki Wiki sites.  It's not iBlog.  But, it does have a pleasant
collaborative work environment.  It only works, however, with certain releases
of Windows IE and Mozilla
browsers.

Consequence: iBlog from
home office.  Bloki from the road. 
:-(

See `slott.bloki.com <http://slott.bloki.com>`_ .  Got R. Lucente to
put `his project <http://rlucente.bloki.com>`_  on bloki,
also.
