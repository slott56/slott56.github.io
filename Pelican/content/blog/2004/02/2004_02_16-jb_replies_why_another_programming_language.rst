The most common argument for introducing YAPL
goes like this:



"There are way too many
programming languages out there. And they are each flawed in some way (small and
odd, or large and incomprehensible). So I, in my wisdom and will create YAPL,
which will displace all these other, inferior
PL."



Of course the vast majority of
other PLs were created for very similar reasons. There are two other motivations
common in creating programming
languages.



-   An experiment: "Let's try
    this and see what happens."

-   Scratching an
    itch: "I have a problem that's too hard to address with the tools at
    hand."



The latter often get over-sold
on the assumption that everyone else "ought" to have the same itch. But
sometimes these work. The former sometimes take off to the astonishment of the
originators. The first kind of new language mentioned, the "new, better
solution", takes continual pushing up-hill to get it adopted, as it often solves
a problem the originator thinks other people have, in a way that the originator
believes others should find
useful.



Aside from that, yet another
programming language is a fine idea. Especially one that's verbose,
inconsistent, and probably incomplete without some kind of big
magic.
