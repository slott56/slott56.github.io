Years and years ago I started using
Delphi internet services.  They had a complicated dialup arrangement through
Sprintnet and Tymenet to a farm of VAX servers in the Boston area, part of
Northeast Education and Research (NEAR) net.  This was Delphi internet,
character-mode, 9600 baud.  I used Mac classic and an external modem.  It was
primitive, but effective.

Back in 96
or thereabouts, Delphi closed down their dial-up service, and switched their
customers to Mindspring.  I continued to use a Delphi.com email address until
they stopped that service also.  When Delphi folded up shop entirely (in 98?), I
switched to using yahoo.com as my mail address, using Mindspring for dialup and
for web page hosting.  Mindspring was bought by Earthlink, but this didn't
change my access.

Since starting to
use Road Runner back in '00 or '01, I've kept both a dial-up Mindspring account
and a road-runner account.  Basically I could keep my Mindspring web site for
under $60 per year, even though I didn't make much use of their dial-up service.


Now that I'm paying for a
**.mac** 
site, it's hard to justify keeping the Mindspring site running.  So, I've
restructured my site slightly, moved it to .mac.  The final step is to replace
the old site with a much of meta tags that redirect back to the .mac
site.
