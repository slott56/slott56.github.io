Just a safety note for folks who use a lot of electricity. In the
winter, you might have computers and space heaters. Or you might (like
me) live "off the grid". We use an inverter with a transfer relay to
switch between battery power and grid power.
Recently, we had a bad smell. Here's the root cause analysis of the
smell.

Do Not Overload AC Wiring.



Figure out how many amps your computers, monitors and winter-time
space heater actually use. The numbers are displayed in various
places around plugs and plates on the backs of things. A few devices
will list power in watts -- divide by 120 to get amps. A 1500W heater
is 12.5A.



Next figure out what your circuit breakers can handle. Many household
circuits are 15A. A power strip may not even handle 10A. Two space
heaters in one room is likely to exceed the wiring's current carrying
capacity.



The root cause of the melted connector block might be a design flaw
-- the block may have been too small for the rated load of 30A. While
the device overall seems good, this kind of shabby engineering is
alarming.
