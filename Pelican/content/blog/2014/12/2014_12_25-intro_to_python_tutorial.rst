A very nice tutorial. It's Focused on a specific problem. It covers the
solution technology in some depth. I think the focus and depth features
are important. It's often tempting to cover the technical features
without really *solving* a problem.
In the "real world," we're often pressured to put the first MVP into
production and move on to the next problem. I put "real world" in "scare
quotes" because this approach is as dumb as a bag of hammers. Managers
who insist on installing or shipping the first Minimally Viable Product
are essentially purchasing technical debt instead of a solution.
I like the tutorial because it includes additional aspects like quality
assurance. It's called "Defensive Programming," but it's really QA. I
like to call it "fit and finish." The job's not over until there are
automated tests to demonstrate that its over.
The `Software Carpentry <http://software-carpentry.org/>`__ site as a
whole looks quite good. It seems to have numerous high-quality
tutorials.
