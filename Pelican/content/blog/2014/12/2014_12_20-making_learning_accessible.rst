We autodidacts are rejoicing.

Specifically, I can look at some of the Scala and Hadoop titles. I'm
working with folks who have Hadoop but I've heard rumors that they're
leaning toward Scala, also. Does that mean Apache Spark? Or does it mean
Scalding?

I'm biased toward using Python with Hadoop; but I appear to be in the
minority on this. Time to do some additional learning.
