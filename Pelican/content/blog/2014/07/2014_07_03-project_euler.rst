This is (was?) an epic web site:

Currently, they're struggling with a security problem.

Years ago, I found the site and quickly reached Level 2 by solving a
flood of easy problems.
Recently, a recruiter strongly suggested reviewing problems on Project
Euler as preparation for a job interview.
It was fun! I restarted my quest for being a higher-level solver.
Then they took the solution checking (and score-keeping) features
off-line.
So now I have to content myself with cleaning up my previous solutions
to make them neat and readable and improve the performance in some
areas.
I -- of course -- cannot share the answers. But, I can (and will) share
some advice on how to organize your thinking as you tackle these kinds
of algorithmically difficult problems.
My personal preference is to rewrite the entire thing in Django. It
would probably take a month or two. Then migrate the data. That way I
could use RST markup for the problems and the MathJax add-on that
docutils uses to format math. But. That's just me.
I should probably take a weekend and brainstorm the functionality that I
can recall and build a prototype. But I'm having too much fun solving
the problems instead of solving the problem of presenting the problems.
