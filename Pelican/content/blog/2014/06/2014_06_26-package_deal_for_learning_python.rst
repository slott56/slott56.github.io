| If you're very new to programming in general, Python's a great place
  to start.
| There are many, many tutorials. I won't even try to summarize them.
  They're generally good. And the more you read, the more you learn.
| Moving past the n00bz needs, there are some more advanced books.
  Here's a collection for generalists:

-  http://www.packtpub.com/learning-python-design-patterns/book
-  http://www.packtpub.com/mastering-object-oriented-python/book

| My suggestion is to master the general features of the language
  overall.
| Focus on specific things (Django, NLTK, SciPy, Maya, Scrapy,
  MatPlotLib, etc.) can follow.
| I worry that early exposure to some of the details of Python-based
  packages may obscure the fundamentals of using the language properly.
  Perhaps that worry is misplaced. I know that the `NLTK
  Book <http://www.nltk.org/book/>`__ has numerous good examples of
  Python which are independent of the NLTK focus.
