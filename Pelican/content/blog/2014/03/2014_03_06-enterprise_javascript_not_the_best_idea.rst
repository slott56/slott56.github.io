| The article lists reasons why Enterprise JavaScript is a recipe for
  disaster. "Finally, there's legacy integration..." This is the point.
| In particular, JavaScript needs to get the data from somewhere: a
  backend process. If we push business knowledge into the front-end,
  even if we're assiduous about code libraries and sharing, we still
  have to fight with the "Out-Of-Date JS Library" issue. Server-side
  business knowledge is inherently consistent and sharable.
| The big reason JavaScript feels good is because it's seems productive.
  Java is complex. C++, C#, and Objective C are Very Complex.
| And.
| Backend programming doesn't allow you to see finished-looking stuff
  right away. When you're fooling around with JavaScript you **feel**
  like you're doing real work. You're moving data around on the HTML
  page, that's productivity, right?
| A spreadsheet is just as productive as JavaScript presentation.
   Almost exactly as productive. The underlying data and processing
  still originates somewhere else. That's where the real value lies. In
  the data. In the backend.
