Want a copy free? See this

If you're really interested, I can sign a copy.  That will double the
shipping cost, so perhaps that's not the best idea.

The bad news is that the errata have started to trickle in. Some of the
default serialization cases in chapter 9 aren't handled properly. The
demonstrations don't exercise the defaults very well, so things happen
to work for me, but don't work when generalized or pulled out of
context.

Sigh.

What's important -- I guess -- is that we have a critical mass of
readers who are applying the concepts and finding problems.
