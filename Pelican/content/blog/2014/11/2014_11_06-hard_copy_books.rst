I've now got my actual souvenir hard-copies of my two Packt books
https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-object-oriented-python
https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/python-secret-agents
So far, so good. I've got one more title in the works. After that, I
think I'll have to take a small break and do some development work and
learn more new stuff.
I've been advised to square away my Amazon.com author's page.

I think this will work to help folks post questions, comments, and
suggestions.
