Book (pre) Announcement:

- KDP - See https://www.amazon.com/stores/Steven-Lott/author/B00HNRSLEK for my author's page.
    https://www.amazon.com/Unlearning-SQL-hammer-every-problem-ebook/dp/B0DDMFMXNW is the book.

- Google Play - See https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=23WAEAAAQBAJ. Be sure to get the 2024.08 edition; there's a previous edition (from 2022) out there, also. Don't buy the 2022 edition.

- Lulu - https://www.lulu.com/shop/steven-lott/unlearning-sql/paperback/product-yvnm8zn.html. It may be a few weeks before I get the proof copy and can formally approve it.

This is still early in the process, and there are still some technical reviews from the ebook web sites to make sure the book really is what it claims to be.

The code is tps://github.com/slott56/unlearning-sql and was rewritten and tested.
