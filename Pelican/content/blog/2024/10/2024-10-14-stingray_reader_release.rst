Starting back in 2011 I was working on a way to manage a variety of spreadsheets in a variety of layouts with a common schema.
Over the last 13 years, I've been updating and maintaining this little project.
It's not widely used, but it interests me.

Fundamentally, the use of well-defined schema is really important.
And often overlooked.

History
========

See `More Command-Line Goodness <{filename}/blog/2011/10/2011_10_13-more_command_line_goodness.rst>`_.
This started as an elaborate exercise in literate programming.
In 2012, I got some feedback.
See `Stingray Schema-based File Reader <{filename}/blog/2012/06/2012_06_07-stingray_schema_based_file_reader.rst>`_

In 2014, I added and refactored it quite a bit.
See `Python Package Design, Refactoring and the Stingray Reader Project <{filename}/blog/2014/05/2014_05_22-python_package_design_refactoring_and_the_stingray_reader_project.rst>`_
and `Stingray 4.4 Update -- the Posix split command applied to COBOL files <{filename}/blog/2014/05/2014_05_29-stingray_44_update_the_posix_split_command_applied_to_cobol_files.rst>`_
and `TDD, API Design and Refactoring <{filename}/blog/2014/06/2014_06_12-tdd_api_design_and_refactoring.rst>`_.
Busy year.
This was the tail end of my hiatus, and I was back to looking for paying jobs.

In 2015, I considered the Literate Programming nature of the project.
See `Literate Programming and GitHub <{filename}/blog/2015/06/2015_06_23-literate_programming_and_github.rst>`_.

Then. Work interfered.

In 2018, I added some things.
See `Coping with a Spreadsheet Database <{filename}/blog/2018/07/2018_07_02-coping_with_a_spreadsheet_database.rst>`_.

Also, I moved from SourceForge to GitHub.
See `The SourceForge vs. GitHub Conundrum <{filename}/blog/2018/10/2018_10_30-the_sourceforge_vs_github_conundrum.rst>`_.

In 2020, some more upgrades.
See `StingrayReader Upgrade <{filename}/blog/2020/01/2020_01_26-stingrayreader_upgrade.rst>`_,
`Stingray Reader Rewrite <{filename}/blog/2020/01/2020_01_31-stingray_reader_rewrite.rst>`_, and
`Stingray Reader Pervasively Bad Decision <{filename}/blog/2020/02/2020_02_25-stingray_reader_pervasively_bad_decision.rst>`_,

In 2021, some more revisions, mostly related to annotations.
See `Spreadsheets, COBOL, and Schema-Driven File Processing <{filename}/blog/2021/08/2021_08_24-spreadsheets_cobol_and_schema_driven_file_processing.rst>`_.
Also `Reading Spreadsheets with Stingray Reader and Type Hinting <{filename}/blog/2021/11/2021_11_16-reading_spreadsheets_with_stingray_reader_and_type_hinting.rst>`_.
And `Processing Apple Numbers Files <{filename}/blog/2021/12/2021_12_01-processing_apple_numbers_files.rst>`_.

In 2022, some additional thoughts.
See `The Enterprise COBOL Conundrum <{filename}/blog/2022/07/2022_07_12-the_enterprise_cobol_conundrum.rst>`_.
