I've received a steady flow of email on `Building Skills in Python <http://www.itmaybeahack.com/homepage/books/python.html>`_  and `Building Skills in OO Design <http://www.itmaybeahack.com/homepage/books/oodesign.html>`_ .



Readers have located a number of mistakes.  It's been easy to correct and republish these books on-line. 



At some point, I'll have to start the Python 2.6/3.0 revisions.
