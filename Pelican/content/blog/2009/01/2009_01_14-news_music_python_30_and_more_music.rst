Thing 1 -- My son's album is out today.  You can visit the `Siva Noir <http://sivanoir.com/>`_  site.  You can buy from their site or iTunes.  Samples are available on their `MySpace <http://www.myspace.com/sivanoir>`_  page.



Thing 2 -- More updates on Python 3.0.  The story is not on the SD Times web site yet, but was in the dead-tree edition that arrived today.  The Python 3.0 news feed is helpful information to management; it bolsters that part of our development `plan <{filename}/blog/2008/11/2008_11_08-python_30.rst>`_ .



Thing 3 -- In the "`Short Takes <http://www.sdtimes.com/link/33149>`_ " section of the SD Times, they mentioned the Rick Astley video, which tops off my personal `Rickrolling <{filename}/blog/2008/11/2008_11_29-rickrolling_trifecta.rst>`_  trifecta.



My son isn't on the Barry Manilow, record, just in the advertising video -- he's acting like a musician in the video.  He's a real musician in Siva Noir.
