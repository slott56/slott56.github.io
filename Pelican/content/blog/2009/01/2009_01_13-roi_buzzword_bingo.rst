Here's the article,
"`The New Focus Group: The Collective <http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/jan2009/id2009017_198183.htm>`_ ".



The point is that simplistic Return on Investment misses the point.  The point is that marketing models aren't simple linear relationships between promotional dollars and sales.



I was all excited about the `value of innovation <{filename}/blog/2008/04/2008_04_09-innovation_includes_failure_some_organizations_call_it_learning_however.rst>`_
and the `source of innovation <{filename}/blog/2008/04/2008_04_16-innovation_pushed_to_vendors.rst>`_ .



The article was about small focus groups and avoiding the paralysis of analysis.  Good advice.  A little too cute with the play on "ROI", but still of some value.
