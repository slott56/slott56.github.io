Last week I noticed that some contacts were repeated in my iPhone contacts.  That's awful.  It makes the phone suddenly very hard to use.



I did a little reading, found some stuff about various levels of synchronization.  I have a Mac OS X 10.4, plus 10.5, plus the iPhone, plus my gmail and yahoo! mail accounts.



Something's not working.  I cycled through just about everything until I read the MobileMe news, with this article: `MobileMe: Service Updates as of December 15, 2008 <http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3248>`_ .



Essentially, sync is broken and fixed in 10.5.6.  One OS upgrade and things are fixed.



Currently, I have the Yahoo! and gmail sync off.  Now I can try turning these back on.
