Apple's Time Capsule rocks.

For a while the Airport Extreme Base Station (AEBS) -- with a disk
added -- would do the same thing. You got Time Capsule backups
seamlessly and continuously.

No more. Version 7.4.2. fixed the "bug". Now the AEBS no longer backs
up to a disk.

They've been saying that since Nov '08. See article
`HT2038 <http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2038?viewlocale=en_US>`__. In
spite of that, a lot of folks saw it working. Try this Google
`Search <http://www.google.com/search?q=AirPort+Extreme's+AirPort+Disk+as+a+Time+Machine+backup>`__.

But it worked for me up until this past weekend. The "upgrade" broke
it. Damn.
