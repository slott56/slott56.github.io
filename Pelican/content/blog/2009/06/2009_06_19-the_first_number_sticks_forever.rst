Two months ago, we looked at some Data Warehouse design information.

It looked like 8 months of work. It might be finished by year-end.
Fatal mistake: we gave a "number". Year-end.

subject areas, etc. And, the client delayed their decision-making

didn't create a waterfall schedule. Instead, we defined a typical
release and sprint structure and a backlog.

Our sales person was appalled -- shocked! -- that we could no longer
make year-end.

"Duh," we said. "It's a month longer, starting three months later.
What do you want?"

"We can't tell the customer that," the sales person said.

Sigh.

Situation: normal.

I'm not sure how you'd fix this in a commercial environment, but what I
try to do is get in the same room as the 'salesperson' and the 'client'
every now and then, and force everyone to tally their books together.
