All organizations have an “Official Technology List”.  I work
“Enterprise IT”, where the official languages are limited to Java, VB
.Net, C, C++.  After that... well... it may as well be Esperanto or
\ `Whitespace <http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/>`__\ .



PHP, for example, is near the top of the
\ `TIOBE <http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html>`__\ 
index, but often shunned as “not enterprise ready”.



I’m using Python and folks have things to say: mostly tongue-clucking
and eye-rolling.  So far, however, it’s working because things are so
easy to develop, test and change.
