iBlog doesn’t work well -- and hasn’t for a while.

I have iWeb as part of my iLife package -- and I use iLife heavily.

Perhaps it’s time to move.


There are some small “howevers” in that.

-  344 blog entires that I’d like to migrate to iWeb.  It remains to be
   seen what I can do about that.  They’re all still on my legacy
   “S.Lott - Software Architect” site, so it’s possible to simply refer
   to them and otherwise ignore them.  While iBlog has an export, iWeb
   doesn’t have an import.

-  Google Adsense channel settings.  The iWeb Adsense widget appears to
   be a kind of dumb default.  I should probably just insert an HTML
   widget (with real Adsense code) instead of using the iWeb Adsense
   widget.

-  iBlog kindly built automatic links to del.icio.us, digg, furl,
   reddit, YahooMyWeb.  I’m not sure how to edit the blog templates here
   in iWeb.   The XML files used in the templates are pretty opaque.
   I’d like digg, facebook, tweet and track, stumble upon, reddit,
   del.icio.us, and yahoo buzz.  But, then I’d need to ferret our the
   permalink from iWeb’s internals and generate the HTML.  Sigh.
   Perhaps I need
   `iWebBuddy <http://www.zarrastudios.com/ZDS/iWebBuddy.html>`__.


Some things appear to be a wash.

-  iBlog created Haloscan Comment and Trackback links.  iWeb replaces
   this with it’s own commenting.

-  iBlog created nice Technorati links for related material.  But I
   don’t know that this was all that useful, since I never paid close
   attention to getting my Technorati tags aligned with everyone else.
