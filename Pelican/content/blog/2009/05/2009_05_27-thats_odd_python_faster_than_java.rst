Here's an amazing Stack Overflow
`question <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/918359/my-python-program-executes-faster-than-my-java-version-of-the-same-program-what>`__.

The follow-up conversation is great stuff.

The question shows two versions of approximately the same processing.
Python is faster than Java.  That's unexpected.

Java has static compilation and the hot-spot translation to machine
code.  Apparently, Python has some optimizations that are just as
valuable.
