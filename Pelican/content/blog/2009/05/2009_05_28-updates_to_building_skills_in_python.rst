I got a bug report (back in April) about an exercise in `Building Skills
in Python <http://homepage.mac.com/s_lott/books/python.html>`__.  It was
a change from 2.2 that I never validated in 2.5.   Thanks to my readers
for responding with questions and complaints.

I've finally updated and posted the revisions.

Further, after some
`questions <http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%5Bpython%5D+class+instance>`__
on Stack Overflow, I've decided to revisit parts of `Chapter
21 <http://homepage.mac.com/s_lott/books/python/htmlchunks/ch21.html>`__.

Specifically `this
question <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/900929/need-help-with-the-class-and-instance-concept-in-python>`__
leads me to conclude that there's an audience that's served by a
little more depth in this area.

On the Building Skills in Python page, the link to pdf file is wrong,
