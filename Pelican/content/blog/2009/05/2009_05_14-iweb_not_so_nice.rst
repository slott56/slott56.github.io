For techincal blogging (like this) iWeb is weak.

The total MacOSX integration -- pictures, podcast, etc. -- is nice.
It's very cool for my travelogues. But for code samples and the kind
of customized HTML widgets that are required by Technorati, it's too
hard to deal with.

The size of the iWeb pages is magnificent.  Reading a posting is an
undertaking.  I don't really like that, since this is mostly simple
text; the ultra complex graphics aren't an asset.

For now, I still have to mess around with the ShareThis link.  I'm
not sure if I like the sophistication of Share This or if I want
button-by-button links to digg, facebook, tweet and track, stumble
upon, reddit, del.icio.us, and yahoo buzz buttons on each post.
