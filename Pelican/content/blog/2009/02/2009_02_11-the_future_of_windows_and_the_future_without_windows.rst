The disruption from Microsoft's failures are only starting to be felt.  Check out Frank Hayes' "`The Pain Begins <http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&taxonomyName=Management&articleId=332889>`_ " column in the January 26th Computer World.



Corporate IT stubbed Vista.  What will it do with Windows 7?  And what's the fall-back plan if Windows 7 is bust and Microsoft does an "end-of-life" in Windows XP to force upgrades and purchases?



It won't be pretty.  Microsoft will start to lose even more ground.  And the open-source OS world will blossom into a dozen competing offerings with complex services, support, help-desk, SaaS add-ons.  It will be much more complex.



It will be very disruptive to current ways of working.  With a single desktop OS, purchasing is easy.  Find a hardware vendor, pick a few items out of a catalog.  Buy the same OS for servers, and to claim to be an all-Microsoft shop.  People currently (with a straight face) claim they never use open source software (in spite of Apache, Java and Perl).  



When Windows is bust, what then?



Every decision will require thinking.  That will hurt.
