See the `10 Open Source Opportunities <http://www.cioinsight.com/c/a/IT-Management/10-Areas-Where-Open-Source-is-Open-for-Business/?kc=CIOMINEPNL01302009>`_  entry in CIO Minute.



The OS and Virtualization territory is already staked out.  Not sure this will be a real opportunity space.



Enterprise applications (CRM, ERP, BI) are scary.  Scary because these are purchased by CIO's.  CIO's are herd animals and -- of course -- an open source enterprise package will *never*  be acceptable.



Clearly, there's a lot of room to make money here by shoving SAP, Oracle and TriZetto Group aside.  I think that you can easy implement a simpler application than these legacy behemoths.



Technology (Mobile, VOIP, Security) This has a lot of room for growth.  It's enabling or foundational technology.  Lots of space here.



Tools and Browsers are totally crowded with freeware.  I'm not sure there's any money-making opportunity here.  ActiveState and WingWare are who you start competing against.  Then you've got to work against Oracle, IBM, the Eclipse Foundation, Sun's NetBeans.  Mozilla, Opera, etc.
