The old code was 5700 lines of bad VB.
The new code is `Velocity <http://velocity.apache.org/>`__, `Flying
Saucer <https://xhtmlrenderer.dev.java.net/>`__,
`iText <http://www.lowagie.com/iText/>`__ and 120 lines of glue. The old
code will be replaced with perhaps 500 lines of XHTML-producing Velocity
templates.

[The Flying Saucer site -- with the main menu on the right -- was
confusing at first. It made it look like a half-baked semi-functional
idea for an open source project. Boy was I wrong. It totally rocks!]

I am absolutely delighted at the FS world-view.

-   Process the entire CSS specification -- every feature --
    especially those related to printing.

-   Don't tolerate malformed XHTML. Gecko tolerates all kinds of HTML
    problems, making it big and sophisticated. Flying Saucer just
    doesn't tolerate ill-formed XML, making it simpler, and more able
    to handle every CSS nuance.

Since the document is very simple (with no side-bars or floating
elements), simple CSS works. And the Flying Saucer PDF matches the
HTML completely. The match was so good that I did a double-take at
the first PDF I made.

The best part is being able to chuck 1000's of lines of VB and
replace them with 100's of lines of XHTML. I think that could
stand to reduce long-term maintenance costs.
