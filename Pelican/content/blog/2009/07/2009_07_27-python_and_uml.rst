Searched for this the other day. Came up empty. Clearly, didn't search
hard enough.

`Automatically Generated Python Code from an UML
diagram? <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1190854/automatically-generated-python-code-from-an-uml-diagram>`__
So far, there are three separate answers listing a total of five
separate products.

I really want to annotate the UML with docstrings. If that was
supported, it would be cool. Then my Sphinx documentation would
include UML images pulled from the code itself.
