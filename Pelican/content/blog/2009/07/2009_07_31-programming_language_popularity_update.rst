I used to rely on the TIOBE Software `Programming Community
Index <http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html>`__.

Today, I learned about the `langpop <http://www.langpop.com/>`__
site. The context was following an SD Times blog posting on Haskell.
But I got distracted looking at language rankings and what it means
to consulting companies.

[Until corrected, I was] particularly drawn to langpop's Amazon
listing. It seems like everyone wants books on C, C++ and C#. All
other languages are also-rans. Why? [I guessed] that it's because
those languages are so (a) hard to work with and (b) are perceived as
"old school" where print resources are more prevalent than on-line
resources. [Turns out the rankings are screwed up. Dang.]

**Marketplace**

The langpop aggregate ranking is C, Java, C++, PHP, JavaScript, C#
and Python. The TIOBE Community Index is Java, C, C++, PHP, VB, C#,
Python.

Similar enough to confirm that a half-dozen languages dominate with
two others fighting for position.

Years ago, one of our senior consultants made the case that we really
have three fundamental tech-stacks into which our web services had to
fit: VB/.Net, C#/.Net, and Java. Corporate IT doesn't demand a lot of
PHP or Python from us.

Perhaps those are opportunities for growth. Or perhaps there isn't
enough corporate IT demand for those frameworks.

Hi,
langpop.com guy here. The amazon rankings are screwed up right now, as
Amazon seems to have some kind of malfunction in their search that they
didn't used to. Sorry to disappoint.
