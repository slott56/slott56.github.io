Got this question recently.

 "Any suggestions on PM tools that meet the following
 considerations

 1) Planning

 2) Estimating

 3) Tracking (allowing both PM input and developer input)

 4) Reporting

 5) Support both Agile and Waterfall projects

 6) Releases

 7) Bug fixes (probably just another type of backlog)"

--------------

Agile PM requires far less planning than you're used to.

1.  A "backlog" which is best done on a spreadsheet.

2.  Daily standup meetings which last no more than 15 minutes at
    the absolute longest.

And that's about it.

Let's look at these expectations in some detail. This is
important because Agile PM is a wrenching change from waterfall
PM.

Planning
--------

There are two levels of detail in planning. The top level is
the overall backlog. This is based on the "complete
requirements" (hahaha, as if such a thing exists). You have an
initial planning effort to decompose the "requirements" into a
workable sequence of deliverables and sprints to build those
deliverables. Don't over-plan -- things will change. Don't
invest 120 man-hours of effort into a plan that the customer
will invalidated with their first change request. Just
decompose into something workable. Spend only a few days on
this.

The most important thing is to prioritize. The backlog must
always be kept in priority order. The most important things to
do next are at the top of the backlog. At the end of every
sprint, you review the priorities and change them so that the
next thing you do is the absolutely most valuable thing you can
do. At any time, you can stop work, and you have done something
of significant value. At any time, you can review the next few
sprints and describe precisely how valuable those sprints will
be.

The micro level of detail is the next few deliverables. No more
than four to six. Don't over-plan. Review the deliverables in
the backlog, correcting, expanding, combining and refining as
necessary to create something that will be of value. List the
sprints to build those deliverables. Try to keep each sprint in
the four week range. This is really hard to do at first, but
after a while you develop a rhythm based on features to be
built and skills of the team. You don't know enough going in,
so don't over-plan. After the first few sprints you'll learn a
lot about the business problem, the technology and the team.

Estimating
----------

Rule 1: don't. Rule 2: the estimate is merely the burn rate
(cost per sprint) times the number of sprints. Each sprint
involves the whole team building something that \*could\* be
put into production. A team of 5 with 4 week sprints is a cost
of 5*40*4 (800 man-hours).

Each sprint, therefore, has a cost of 800 man-hours. Period.
The overall project has S sprints. If the project runs more
than a year, stop. Stop. The first year is all you can
rationally estimate this way. Future years are just random
numbers. 5*40*50 = 10,000 man-hours.

Details don't matter because each customer change will
invalidate all of your carefully planned schedules. Just use
sprints and simple multiplies. It's \*more\* accurate since it
reflects the actual level of unknowns.

What about "total cost"? First, define "total". When the
project starts is the "complete requirements" (hahahaha, as if
such a thing actually exists). Then, with each customer change,
this changes. Further, half the requirements are merely
"nice-to-haves". Since they're merely nice, they're low
priority -- at the bottom of the backlog.

Since each sprint creates something deliverable, you can draw a
line under any sprint, call it "done" and call that the "total
cost". Any sprint. Any. There are as many different total costs
as there are sprints, and all of them are right.

Tracking
--------

I don't know what this is. I assume it's "tracking progress of
tasks against a plan". Since the tasks are not planned at a low
level of detail, there's nothing to "track".

You have a daily stand-up. People commit to do something that
day. The next day you find out if they finished or didn't
finish. This isn't a "tool thing". It's a conversation. Done in
under 15 minutes.

Two things can happen during this brief conversation.

-   Things are progressing as hoped. The sprint will include all
    hoped-for features.

-   Things are not progressing as hoped. The sprint may not
    include some feature, or will include an incomplete
    implementation. The sprint will never have bugs -- quality is
    not sacrificial. Features are sacrificial.

There's no management intervention possible. The sprint will
have what it will have. Nothing can change that. More people
won't help. Technology changes won't help. Design changes won't
help. You're mid-sprint. You can only finish the sprint.

AFTER the sprint is over, and you've updated the backlog and
fixed the priorities, you might want to consider design changes
or technology changes.

Reporting
---------

What? To Whom? Each sprint is a deliverable. The report is
"Done".

The backlog is a shared document that the users "own" and you
use to assure that the next sprint is the next most important
thing to do.

Support both Agile and Waterfall projects
-----------------------------------------

Not possible. Incompatible at a fundamental level. You can't do
both with one tool because you don't use tools for Agile
projects. You just use spreadsheets.

Releases
--------

Some sprints are release sprints. They're no different (from a
management perspective) than development sprints. This is just
CM.

Bug fixes
---------

Probably just another type of backlog. Correct.

Very interesting and very realistic approach.
The only thing problematic for me is how to deal with the clients to
define the cost. Usually my clients want to know how much the
development will cost at the beginning for all their "original"
requirements (not necessarely the real ones)?

`agile

can be a real pain where project management is involved. Yes `agile

is alot easier to produce, but it also means it is harder to cost as
well as to ensure the entirety comes together and get's delivered on
time.

To improve productivity of a company and reduce costs, an effective
management software should be used. `Management

long term solution to leverage existing investment in Microsoft
technology.
