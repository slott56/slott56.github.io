I've got a ton of exercises in the `Building
Skills <http://homepage.mac.com/s_lott/books/index.html>`__ books.
Specifically, my `OO
Design <http://homepage.mac.com/s_lott/books/oodesign.html#book-oodesign>`__
book is based on my own personal Code Kata exercises.

Plus there's the established Code Kata resources. The
`CodeKata <http://codekata.pragprog.com/>`__ page, Mark Needham's
blog posting on
`code-kata <http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/tag/code-kata/>`__,
Rizky Farhan's `Collection of Software
Projects <http://frizky.wikidot.com/projects:code-kata>`__,
jp.hamilton's `Code Kata
Resources <http://www.jphamilton.net/post/Coding-Dojo-and-Code-Kata-Resources.aspx>`__.
The `Coding Dojo <http://codingdojo.org/>`__ page (which suffers from
showing no usable URL's -- what a mistake.)

Plus there are the random problem sites: `Project
Euler <http://projecteuler.net/>`__, `Top
Coder <http://www.topcoder.com/>`__,
`UVa <http://uva.onlinejudge.org/>`__,
`SPOJ <http://www.spoj.pl/>`__, Google
`CodeJam <http://code.google.com/codejam/>`__.

I've done a few (63) Project Euler problems (I got stumped by problem
69). Another 37 and I'd be at level 3.

The question isn't "where are the problems?" The question is "Are
these good Code Kata problems?"

This is awesome, thanks for posting all these potential Katas!
I think part of what makes a good Kata is not necessarily the problem,
but the attitude you take to solving it.

For example, a problem that has a difficult domain to understand or
create a solution for (e.g. a Project Euler brain teaser) covers a
different set of skills then something like making a wiki using werkzeug
and AJAX, or focusing on TDD technique with bowling scores.

As long as you have a focus on what skill you're trying to practice and
the problem offers enough opportunity to practice that skill I think it
makes a good Kata.

I think one definition of a good kata is one which takes you outside
your comfort zone, to stretch your abilities.

I think we will continue to see more katas, Dave Thomas came to the idea
while working on an algorithm and trying many different types of
approaches. So software craftsman will continue to stumble upon these
katas (typically within their problem domain) and hopefully publish
their findings.

I try to point this out to fellow co-workers when they get caught up on
something for a period of time unexpectedly .. hmmm, is there a code
kata in there?
