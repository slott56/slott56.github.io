The `E. W. Dijkstra <http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/welcome.html>`__
Archive is a collection of over 1,000 manuscripts that EWD sent around
during his career.

This Stack Overflow question ("`explaining software development to
management <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1229611/explaining-software-development-to-management/1229660#1229660>`__")
had a really brilliant comment on one of the answers.

  Analogies are always leaky, and you will end up with proposed
  solutions that solve the analogy, not your actual problem. Just
  explain the problem in simple terms without comparing it to
  anything physical. Read Edsger Dijkstra's famous 1036 and 854 for
  an insight into the horrors thinkign by analogy is inflicting upon
  us

Follow-up Reading
------------------

`EWD 854 <http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD854.html>`__,
"The fruits of misunderstanding". "when faced with something new and
unfamiliar we try to relate it to what we are familiar with". "a
program is an abstract mechanism". "the mechanism being abstract, its
production is subsumed in its design. In this respect a program is
like a poem: you cannot write a poem without writing it. Yet people
talk about programming as if it were a production process and measure
'programmer productivity' in terms of 'number of lines of code
produced'."

Aha. Software production is subsumed in its design. There is no
"production" other than design. We design at a high level. We design
code. When we've designed the code, we're done. There is no further
development effort.

`EWD 1036 <http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html>`__,
"On the cruelty of really teaching computing science". "From a bit to
a few hundred megabytes, from a microsecond to a half an hour of
computing confronts us with completely baffling ratio of
10\ :sup:`9`"

Love that cautionary note. Computer science forces us to confront
layers of meaning that have a huge scope.

I'll have to work my way through the archive. It will probably take
years to read through all the manuscripts.

Wait -- I've Got One Of Those
------------------------------

Back in the 70's, the undergrads at Syracuse University were given
copies of
`EWD316 <http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd03xx/EWD316.PDF>`__.
At the time, it was just a paper on the art of programming. It sat in
a file drawer for decades. I unearthed it recently.

At the time, EWD316 looked like a course number. I assumed -- wrongly
-- that it was notes from some other school of computer science.
Turns out, it was one of those EWD missives. It had found it's way
into the hands of the CS Faculty at SU. From there, a copy fell into
my hands. Not until recently (30+ years later) did I realize exactly
what it was a copy of.

It's densely-packed stuff. I think `A Discipline of
Programming <http://www.amazon.com/Discipline-Programming-Prentice-Hall-Automatic-Computation/dp/013215871X>`__
is a little bit easier to work with. Further, Gries' `The Science of
Programming <http://books.google.com/books?id=vv5pot-ySsEC&dq=gries+science+of+programming&printsec=frontcover&source=bn&hl=en&ei=8w17SszhNMe3twfr64HtAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4#v=onepage&q=&f=false>`__
is easier still.
