My son's a musician, and one of the standard jokes boils down to the
phrase "no brown M&M's". They use it as a catch-all phrase for people
being fussy to a level that's senseless.

Then BoingBoing pointed me to the `Van Halen Brown
M&M <http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/vanhalen.asp>`__ story in
snopes.com.

The brown M&M's was actually a compliance test. If you read the
contract rider, and complied with all the terms and conditions, you'd
filter the brown M&M's off the buffet.

If you were not prepared for the technical requirements for the Van
Halen show, you'd book them, skip reading the rider, hope it went off
well, and -- generally -- fail to filter the M&M's.

**Statements of Work**

We write a lot of Statements of Work (SOW's) with lots of
"assumptions". A common assumption is that deliverables will be
approved within three days. We often write it, suspecting that the
client can't actually take action in three days.

But we never really know until we start work. Once we're there, we
discover that it takes them a month to get ready to spend five days
reviewing a document and wondering what to do. Now we're five weeks
behind the original schedule, and the customer will blame us for
"springing" the 3-day decision window on them.

If we had a "No Brown M&M's" assumption, perhaps we'd have an earlier
indication that things weren't going to work out well.

**Use Cases**

I'm also wondering if there needs to be a "Brown M&M" use case.
Something egregious, but small. Something that *should* lead to
client confusion. If they approve the scope of work, including the
Brown M&M use case, we know they didn't really read or review the
scope of work.

Perhaps there should be a "Brown M&M" in the architecture. Perhaps an
irrelevant component that we insist must be downloaded and installed
in the development environment. We simply check that it's there. If
not -- well -- what else will be wrong?

My mother-in-law is a theatrical caterer and still has the rider
specifying "no brown M&Ms". My wife tells the story of having to sit w/
her sister and pluck them out of a big bowl of multi-colored M&Ms.
