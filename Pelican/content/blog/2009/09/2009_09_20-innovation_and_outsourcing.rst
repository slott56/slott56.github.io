Good stuff in ComputerWorld: `Partnerships can Go Too
Far <http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/342303/Partnerships_Can_Go_Too_Far>`__.

"Consider vendor innovation. As companies become large and
entrenched, they typically become more risk-averse and less creative,
often rejecting ideas that challenge conventional wisdom."

This is really only half the story.

**First Things First**

Programming is hard -- really hard. Read `EWD 316, chapter
2 <http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD316.2.html>`__.
By extension, most of IT is saddled with really, really complex and
difficult problems.

"As a result of its extreme power, both the amount of information
playing a role in the computations as well as the number of
operations performed in the course of a computation, escape our
unaided imagination by several orders of magnitude. Due to the
limited size of our skull we are absolutely unable to visualize to
any appreciable degree of detail what we are going to set in motion,
and programming thereby comes an activity facing us with conceptual
problems that have risen far, far above the original level of
triviality."

Given that IT is hard, it therefore entails either some risk of
failure or considerable cost to avoid failure. It also involves an --
often unknown -- amount of learning.

Before writing software, we really do need to learn the language,
tools, architecture and components we're going to use. Not a 1-week
introduction, but a real project with real quality reviews. Sometimes
two projects are required to ferret out mistakes.

Also, before writing software, we really do need to understand the
problem. Sadly, many business problems are workarounds to bad
software. Leaving us with many alternative solutions that are all
equally bad and don't address the root cause problem.

**No-Value Features**

Programmers will often pursue no-value features that are part of the
language, tools, components or architecture. This drives up cost and
risk for no value.

**Business Short-Sightedness**

The compounding problem is a short-sighted business impetus toward
delivering something that mostly works as quickly as possible. Often,
business folks buy into the no-value features, and overlook the real
problem that we're supposed to be solving.

Sigh.

**The Result: Stifling**

The result of (a) inherent complexity, (b) no-value features and (c)
short-sighted buyers is that IT management finds ways to stifle all
IT innovation.

In effect, most companies outsource innovation. They hope that their
vendors will provide something new, different and helpful. The IT
organization isn't allowed to invest in the learning or take the
risks necessary to innovate.

The ComputerWorld article points out that some companies then put
Preferred Supplier Plans in place which further stifle innovation by
narrowing the field of vendors to only the largest and least
innovative.
