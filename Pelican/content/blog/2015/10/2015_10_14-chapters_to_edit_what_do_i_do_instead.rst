I'm starting to get chapters back from the technical reviewers. This is
an important part of the writing process: correcting my mistakes and
clarifying things that confused the reviewers.


Packt has had a uniformly excellent cadre of technical reviewers. At
this point, I've worked with something like a dozen people on four
different books. It's been great (for me) to get detailed, specific
feedback point by point.


Instead of working on my reviewed chapters, however, I'm browsing.
It's Python Week.

I'll get to the chapters Thursday, I think.
