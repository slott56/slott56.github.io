My takeaway quote? "Scrum lags behind the modern toolchain enough that
there can be a Potemkin village vibe to the whole thing."
I was clued into this from another takeaway quote someone seconded on
Twitter: "Waterfall used too much written communication, but Agile
doesn't use enough."

Is "sprint" misleading? What about "sprint commitment?"
I'm not sure I object to "sprint" *per se.*
But I have seen "sprint commitment" turned into an organizational
problem, removing what could have been a helpful tool. Folks who start
harping on sprint commitments in the sense of "we committed to this,
will we meet the deadline?" tend to create a toxic environment. I think
the people who hype commitment the most really liked the non-Agile
environments: they try bend Agile to meet their Waterfall concepts.
The problem is the word. A "sprint commitment" shouldn't be used like a
legally binding "do it or pay penalties" commitment. It should be a
metric used to gauge progress. More like a "sprint outcome".
The commitment hype can lead to stories, epics and detailed technical
tasks getting muddied up terribly. The story becomes an epic. Little
tiny technical tasks get inflated into big important stories. A proper
user story gets replaced with nonsense about prepping a database for
production rollout, or resolving defects found in QA, or things that --
obviously -- aren't **user** stories, but are taking up a lot of time.
When it appears that a story is going nowhere, the scrum master breaks
it down into things that have status which changes frequently. The sense
of end-user meaning behind the actual story gets lost in a haze of
technical considerations and tasks that show activity more than
accomplishment more than value.
"As an actuary, I want to know that the developers have written
syntactically correct DML for my database, so that the product owner
don't have to wait as long for the DBA's to build the database."
Really?
