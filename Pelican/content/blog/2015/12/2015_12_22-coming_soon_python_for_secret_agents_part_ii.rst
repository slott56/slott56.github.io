I guess it's like a movie franchise or a series of novels. The first one
was popular. So, write a second story with similar characters.
You can check find part I

and

Part II will be available soon. New missions. New ways to gather and
analyze intelligence information assets.
I should probably read some Ian Fleming or Robert Ludlum boos to get
some ideas for more exciting missions.
I'm more a fan of John le Carr√© stories which are less high-tech and
more about ordinary selling out.
I'm also a fan of the history of `Agent
Garbo <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Pujol_Garcia>`__ and
`Operation
Mincement <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mincemeat>`__. These
are things that are really interesting uses of data, intelligence, and
misdirection.
