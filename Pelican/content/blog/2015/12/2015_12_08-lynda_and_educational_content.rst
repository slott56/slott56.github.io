Just found `http://www.lynda.com <http://www.lynda.com/>`__.

Unlike random YouTube videos, these are professionally edited.

Not everything on YouTube is poorly edited. Some are really good.

Having done a few webcasts for O'Reilly (and I have another scheduled
for January 2016,) I know that my "you knows" -- you know -- and my
"umms" are -- umm -- annoying.

I know professionals -- actors, pastors, lawyers -- who can extemporize
really well. And it raises the bar a lot.

But the idea of having an editor clean up the "you knows" is appealing.
