Years ago -- many years ago -- I self-published three books on Python.
I also set up a Google Group, `Building Skills
Books <https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/building-skills-books>`__,
for a discussion area.
For a while, I check my download logs carefully to see how the book was
being received.
Then I became a tech nomad, and commenced traveling and working from
coffee shops and cellular network hotspots with my phone. The discussion
group went from a luxury to a complexity to a near impossibility.
Now that I have steady connectivity, it's really kind of embarrassingly
awkward that I ignored my readers like that.
For years.
I submit my apology to all of the folks who hoped for a more responsive
author.
What can I do about it?
Nothing to fix the past, obviously. For the moment, while working for
Packt, most of my writing goes to them.
However.
I hope to revisit these Building Skills Books in some depth in the
not-too-distant future. I see three stories on my "As a Reader, I
want..." storyboard.
1) Typos Fixed so the books are readable. Gather all the typos and
corrections from the discussions.
2) Clarifications so the books are more useful. Gather all the
questions, comments, suggestions. Fold those into the rewrites.
3) Python3. The beginner-level Intro to Programming book needs further
revision. (I tried to publish an iBook for the Python3 rewrite and am
not happy with the process or the results.) I think I'll revise it (yet
again) and post it as GitHub pages.
4) Python3. The Intro to Python book needs to be rewritten. It's a HUGE
project, but, I feel that it still has some value because it's
chock-full of exercises and attempts to be really complete. I think I'll
drop the reference material, however. Back in '02 -- when I started the
first draft -- that seemed like it was beneficial. Now it's
approximately worthless.
The OO Design book is a real hand-wringer. The approach of a strict
parallelism between Python and Java can be seen as a disservice to both
languages. On the other hand, I think it's good to focus on
lowest-common denominator features that are common to all OO languages.
I'm undecided on what to do here. I think I'd like to drop Java and add
some additional refactoring exercises.
I need to pick one of these two:
4a) Python Focus for OO Design.
4b) Lowest Common Denominator Focus for OO Design.
There's no precise schedule for this; it's mostly a kind of placeholder
and discussion jumping-off point. Maybe I should start a
proper `https://trello.com <https://trello.com/>`__ board for this.
