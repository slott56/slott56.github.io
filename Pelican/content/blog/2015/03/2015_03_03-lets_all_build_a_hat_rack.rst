Wound up here: "`A Place to Hang Your
Hat <http://hawthornlandings.org/2015/02/13/a-place-to-hang-your-hat/>`__"
and the #LABHR hash tag.

H/T to this post: "`Building a Hat
Rack <http://holdenweb.blogspot.com/2015/02/building-hat-rack.html>`__."

This is a huge idea. I follow some folks from the `Code For
America <http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/>`__ group. The `+Mark
Headd <https://plus.google.com/114627404839878604775>`__  Twitter feed
(@mheadd) is particularly helpful for understanding this movement. Also,
follow `+Kevin
Curry <https://plus.google.com/109275156453163840729>`__ (@kmcurry) for
more insights.

Open Source contributions are often anonymous and the rewards are
intangible. A little bit of tangibility is a huge thing.

My (old) open source Python books have a "donate" button. Once in a
while I'll collect the comments that come in on the donate button.
They're amazingly positive and encouraging. But also private. Since I
have a paying gig writing about Python, I don't need any more
encouragement than I already have. (Indeed, I probably need less
encouragement.)

However.

There are unsung heroes at every hackathon and tech meetup who could
benefit from some recognition. Perhaps they're looking for a new job or
a transition in their existing job. Perhaps they're looking to break
through one of the obscure social barriers that seem to appear in a
community where everyone looks alike.

And. There's a tiny social plus to being the Recognizer in Chief.
There's a lot to be said in praise of the talent spotters and friction
eliminators.
