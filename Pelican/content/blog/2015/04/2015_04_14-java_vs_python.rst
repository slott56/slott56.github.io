Seems silly at first.

It's mostly true. It's also incomplete.

For example, "no tuples in Java" ignores
http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/tuple/package-summary.html.

It seems like the only interesting takeaway from the infographic is
that Java syntax is wordy.

One hesitates at a detail-by-detail comparison. Does it help to match
the 20 or so statements in Python against equivalents in Java?  Does
it help to match the byzantine complexity of Java
public/protected/private against something that doesn't exist in
Python? Does it even make sense to try and compare the complexity of
Java annotations with anything? What about Python meta-programming?

The fact that we can easily overload Python operators?

Perhaps it's only because I'm an expert in both languages that I
hesitate to try point-by-point comparison.
