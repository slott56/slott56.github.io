From a sound engineer I know:

https://www.avid.com/US/products/pro-tools-software#Features

   This is the new Pro Tools, it's now a subscription, for a mere $200 a
   year to stay current. However, if you peruse the list of new
   features, they all say "coming soon". You pay a subscription fee
   today for features that aren't even live yet. It's like I'm paying
   for an open beta of PT12

   I feel this is becoming a more prevalent and systemic problem in
   software development. Am I wrong? What is going on here?


Is it right to ask a fee in advance for features to be developed in
the future? Is this a sustainable business model? Or will customers
eventually rebel and switch to another product with better licensing
terms and conditions?

Further, this clearly isn't a "purchase" in any traditional sense.
Software has always lived in a weird zone where you don't really
purchase the software in any sense, you purchase a right to use the
software under limited terms and conditions spelled out in an end-user
agreement that you probably didn't read. Since you didn't actually
purchase it, you can't reverse engineer it or modify it.

It's my understanding that Avid's Pro Tools is the gold standard in
the sound engineering industry. It seems unlikely that open source
startups will catch up to the power of Avid's product offerings and
undercut their pricing.

But -- of course -- who could imagine that MySQL or PostgreSQL would
erode significant marketshare from Oracle or IBM?  Indeed, how much
marketshare has been consumed by SQLite?

Software prices appear to have plummeted over the decades. In some
cases, the drop is real and the root cause seems to be open source
tools to build software. In other cases, the drop is a spreading of
costs via subscription services like this one.

What if Avid doesn't deliver on their promises? You've forked over
$200 and didn't get the promised new features. What now?
