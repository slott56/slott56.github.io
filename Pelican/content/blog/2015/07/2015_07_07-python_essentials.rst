Get Packt's `Python
Essentials <https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/python-essentials>`__.
I think it covers a large number of important topics. Central to this is
Python 3.4.
The book covers Python 3 with few -- if any -- backward glances. If it
makes any mention of Python 2, the reference is strictly derogatory.
There isn't even a mention of the old print statement, that's how
forward-looking this is. The Python3 division operators are covered
without the complexity of explaining the old Python 2 approach; the from
\__future_\_ import division is not mentioned once.
I've used a similar outline for training material at places with a mixed
bag of Python 2 and Python 3. This leads to awkwardness because of the
Python 2 quirks that have to be explained.
I prefer a clean approach. The essentials. Python 3 all the way.
