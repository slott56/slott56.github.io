Higher-Order Functions. A really cool idea. Javascript isn't my favorite
language.

This, on the other hand, is huge: trunk-based development.

I'm really tired of having a dev branch with periodic commits to master
so we can deploy from master. It's so much nicer to tag a release and
deploy that.
Here's the top 10 Python list for September 2017.

Why we switched from Python to
Go: https://codeburst.io/why-we-switched-from-python-to-go-60c8fd2cb9a9.
We distribute a CLI for our API in Go because it's slightly simpler to
provide executables in Go. However, our user community has Python
already... We need to provide similar functionality in Python.

Software Engineering v.
Programming. https://medium.com/@samerbuna/software-engineering-is-different-from-programming-b108c135af26
Annotations in Java? Ugh. The level of complexity seems to have gotten
out of

Programming vs. the text of the code
itself. https://medium.com/@karolismasiulis/programming-is-not-about-text-c205ba6aa3ba I'm
don't by the reductionist 1-dimensional view of text. Yes -- in a
narrow, technical sense, it's one-dimensional. If you want to be really
reductionist, it's a stream of bytes, which are really just a base-256
number. I don't think the reductionist argument is helpful. However, I
am sure that the declarative/imperative distinction is worthy of a lot
of thought, and this is a nice comparison. (In spite of the javascript.)
