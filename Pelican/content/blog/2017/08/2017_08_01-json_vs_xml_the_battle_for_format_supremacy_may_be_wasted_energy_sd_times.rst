This article seems silly. Perhaps I missed something important.
I'm not sure who's still litigating the JSON vs. XML, but it seems like
it's more-or-less done.
XHTML/XML for HTML things.
JSON for everything else.
Maybe there are people still wringing their hands over this. AFAIK, the
last folks using SOAP/XML services are commercial and governmental
agencies where change tends to happen very slowly.
I remember when Sun Microsystems was a company and had the Java
Composite Applications Suite. Very XML. That was -- perhaps -- ten years
ago. Since then, I think the problem has been solved. I'm not sure who's
battling for supremacy or why.
