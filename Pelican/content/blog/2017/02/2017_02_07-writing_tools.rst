What I have been doing instead of using these sophisticated,
integrated writing tools?

I use OmniOutliner. https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner I've used
it for years. It does a lot of things. Most notably, I can create
multiple columns so that I can create page budgets for outlines.

Acquisition Editors like this. Except, of course, they like it as an
DOCX file, which requires a bit of manual juggling to produce.
I use BBEdit and KomodoEdit for a the bulk of my
writing. `http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html <ttp://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html>`__

"But wait," you say, "those are text editors."
(Or, more dismissively, "there are merely text editors.")

Correct.  I use RST markup and write in Unicode text.  I use tools to
convert the RST text to a variety of other binary formats.
See http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/tools.html for a list
of tools. This is what I often use:

-   rst2odt creates ODT files which can be then converted to DOCX.

-   rst2html creates web pages.

-   rst2epub creates ePub files. From there, Kindlegen can convert to
    Kindle-unique format. https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211

How is this better than a tool like Scrivener? It depends -- as
always -- on what you're trying to optimize. My pipeline has the
(dubious) advantage of being very inexpensive. Except for
OmniOutliner and BBEdit, it's all community-edition, free software.
If cheap is your goal, I've got cheap.

The cool part is this.

The Mac OS X desktop is an integrated writing environment. I have
browser, outliner, writing tool, publishing tool, etc., etc., all
readily and immediately available. The "look and feel" isn't
consistent, but I'm not sure that's a show-stopper.

The biggest difficulty?

BBEdit doesn't enable the Mac OS X grammar checker. Really. It's
switched off. The grammar checker is sometimes handy for preventing a
large number of common, dumb writing mistakes. BBEdit shows the word
count, which is very helpful for some kinds of writing. I wind up
using a second app (i.e. the built-in Mac OS X TextEdit) to make a
grammar check pass.

I think, however, the hacker-friendly free-and-open-source tool chain
may have reached the end of its service life.

Why Not Use Word?
-----------------

"After all," you say, "MS-Word does everything."

Agreed. It does everything badly and confusingly. (1) The outliner is
hard to use and is firmly tied to the text in a way that breaks
outlines all the time. (*What's that paragraph doing there? Why is it
the wrong outline level?*) (2) There are too many useless features.
The presence of "advanced" mode is a UX nightmare come true. (3) The
character-mode and paragraph-mode formatting rules are baffling (and
break the outlining.) (4) The styles are essentially invisible: you
have to click on the text and check the style side-bar to be sure
that the (invisible) markup is actually right.

The worst thing is that publishers have house style sheets for
MS-Word that drive the publishing pipeline. This means that writing
involves a weird step where I have to apply the publishers styles to
things that are \**very*\* clearly annotated with RST markup. You
have to review each word. The words may look right, but have the
wrong style applied. This is extremely tiresome to get right.

I intend to stick with plain-text markup. Scrivener supports
`MultiMarkdown <https://rawgit.com/fletcher/human-markdown-reference/master/index.html>`__.
It's not
`RST <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`__,
but it seems to be as rich with built-in semantic categories.

I think that every writer either amateur and professional should use
wiring tools, proofreading tools or even `essay
tools <https://essaytoolbox.com/>`__, basically everything they could to
improve their work. Not only that this could save them some nerves but
also help them improve their writing skill
