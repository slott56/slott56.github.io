| It is hard (for me) to promote my books. It seems like empty vanity. I
  realize that it's not -- promotion is essential -- but it's difficult.
| Packt just send a raft of detailed information for authors. Some
  things they suggest I do.

-  ‚úÖReferrals. Want a "free" Python book? The "free" is in scare quotes
   because you'll have to write a review. Otherwise, the book is yours.
   DM me @s_lott and I'll put you on the list.
-  ‚úÖAmazon Author
   Profile: https://www.amazon.com/Steven-Lott/e/B00HNRSLEK Check.
-  Packt Blog Posts. Interesting. I'll have to look into that. I think
   they can follow the RSS feed from here. If they can, check, this is
   done.
-  ‚û°Ô∏èOther on-line PR. Cool. I give them the blogs I follow. Nice. I can
   do that.
-  ‚úÖSocial Media. I (sort-of) link these blog posts to my Twitter feed
   through `https://dlvrit.com <https://dlvrit.com/>`__. But I'm
   half-hearted about it. Packt suggests in including @PacktAuthors so
   that there's a proper Twitter tie-in. That seems like there's no work
   to that. Also, there's a `Packt Experts Author Community on
   Facebook <https://www.facebook.com/groups/457541617915438/#_=_>`__.
-  ‚úÖBlog. Got it. You're reading this. And, also,
   here: https://medium.com/@s_lott.
-  ‚û°Ô∏èAuthor Newsletter. This seems like next-level blogging with more
   serious editorial planning. Interesting.
-  üÜíPackt Promotions. I like this: they do the marketing. I just have
   to cooperate by sharing the information.
-  üÜíVirtual Book Release Party. Wait. This could be cool. *Functional
   Python Programming 2e* is coming next summer. Hmmm. This could be
   fun. Banners and raffles for freebies or discounts.
-  üöªAuthor Street Team. Mutual Support. Advanced Copies. I would need
   to keep it organized, right? That's (potentially) a chunk of work.
   I'll need to contemplate that
-  ‚úÖConferences. This is fun. For one of my PyCon trips, I got a promo
   code from Packt for free content during the conference. That was
   handy to give out. I went to Vistaprint and had a box of cards
   printed with contact info and the promotion code.
-  ‚û°Ô∏èPackt Live on-line conferences. I've done a few webinars. They're
   difficult. Writing is easier because it unfolds more slowly. I'll
   have to look into doing a few more of these.
-  ‚úÖLinkedIn Profile. https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-lott-029835/

| 
| I've hit a few. A few more to do.
| This is a pretty comprehensive list. It's good to see this kind of
  author support.
| Also. They've done some serious re-engineering on their Author
  toolchain. MS-Word documents seem to be a thing of the past.
