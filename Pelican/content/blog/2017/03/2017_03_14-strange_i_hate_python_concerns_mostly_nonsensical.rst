rom a troll-bait thread asking the argumentative question "why do
people use Python"? The answers were, oddly, a long list of strange,
nonsensical complaints. And a few logical fallacies. Here are all the
ones I could parse:

#.  "It's the FORTRAN of our times."

#.  It's the COBOL of our times.

#.  "deep seated aversion to languages where whitespace has fundamental
    syntactic significance".

#.  "And also where the simplest "Hello world!" program is busted between
    v2 and v3 (true story)"

#.  "My stomach turns in a knot at the introduction of EVERY trendy language"

#.  "I am almost always focused on productization qualities such as
    maintainability, performance, and any number of other "-ilities"."

#.  Nobody [cares] about Your language unless You can produce executable

#.  "It's ghastly. The Python Tools for Visual Studio eases the pain with
    a full symbolic/visual debugger but still..."

#.  "the socialist theme of universities leads to preference for open
    source and "free" over professionally developed and maintained
    tools... Meanwhile I really like JavaScript as a free wheeling
    scripting language."

#.  "Python ... is an inferior language. I can trust a well-engineered
    JavaScript system."

#.  "it's worse than fortran because it has a dedicated following"

#.  "my indictment is maintainability once productized. I always have a
    fear of building legacy packages that, once a mountain is built and
    is difficult to move, that people of the future will curse my name"

#.  "rationally, the continuing investment in the Node/TypeScript
    infrastructure places JavaScript in an entirely different
    infrastructure realm than Python"

#.  "Python doesn't have its equivalent of Node.js"

#.  "as a LANGUAGE JavaScript has great infrastructure across device
    types, OS brands, and across every level of scale now imaginable"

#.  Four separate reasoning-by-analogy: Lisp, FoxPro, PHP, and Perl.
    (e.g., "Amazon did amazing things with perl.") Somehow a failure
    involving these languages (or ecosystems or whatever) indicts Python
    because they're all "trendy" (I think.)

Yes. There were others that made less sense. I've omitted them.
TL;DR: These people don't seem to know what they're talking about.
The posts are universally fact-free, so we're just listening to folks
rambling randomly about Python.

Some responses. Feel free to use these when someone asks you why
you're still using Python.


#.  That makes no sense

#.  That makes no sense

#.  The languages which are totally free of whitespace appear to be C and maybe C++. This principle rules out JavaScript, since the ASI rules involve wrangling ";" in place of the evil whitespace.

#.  This is a weird complaint. Stuff changed. How is that a problem?
    Are you saying change is a problem? What's this then?

#.  Trendy is a problem? Really?

#.  Who isn't focused on quality attributes?

#.  http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/shipping/freezing/

#.  What does "ghastly" mean?

#.  What's a "socialist theme"? How is JavaScript "free-wheeling"? What does that even mean?

#.  What is "inferior" being measured? Alphabetically? (Python comes
    after Javascript, so it's in an inferior position alphabetically?)

#.  How is a dedicated following a problem?

#.  http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html Python is second to Java.

#.  "continuing investment"? By whom? And how does this "investment"
    compare with Python?

#.  What's wrong with `twisted <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/>`__,
    `tornado <http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/>`__,
    `Gunicorn <http://gunicorn.org/>`__, and
    `Nginx <https://www.fullstackpython.com/nginx.html>`__? Don't they count?

#.  Python is available more-or-less everywhere. Without a specific
    coverage gap, this makes no sense.

#.  Also known as the False Equivalence fallacy. Without details of
    the failure mode, equivalence with Python isn't established.


Omitted is a random discussion on how Ruby is "rigorously
defined". The implication seems to be that Python somehow might
not be rigorously defined or something. It's not clear what the
sub-thread was about, so I ignored it.

This thread seemed to involve two kinds of complaints:

-  Utter nonsense.

-  Lies that are pretty east to refute.
