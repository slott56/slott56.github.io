The question was "Favorite Design Patterns."

This is tricky because -- well -- so many patterns appear and re-appear in software.
Picking a few from the vast world of patterns is fraught with difficulties.

Here are some thoughts:

- `Code Quality - Which Implementation is "Better"? <{filename}/blog/2007/01/2007_01_03-code_quality_which_implementation_is_better.rst>`_

- `State-Based Object Modeling <{filename}/blog/2007/06/2007_06_25-state_based_object_modeling.rst>`_

- `Functional Programming and Finite State Automata (FSA) <{filename}/blog/2022/11/2022_11_29-functional_programming_and_finite_state_automata_fsa.rst>`_

- `Deconstructing Programs from C; or Finding The Objectsâ„¢ <{filename}/blog/2007/09/2007_09_21-deconstructing_programs_from_c_or_finding_the_objects.rst>`_

- `Python Business Rules Engine <{filename}/blog/2009/02/2009_02_20-python_business_rules_engine.rst>`_

- `The Anti-IF Campaign <{filename}/blog/2010/12/2010_12_27-the_anti_if_campaign.rst>`_

Yes. That's a lot of writing on design patterns.
