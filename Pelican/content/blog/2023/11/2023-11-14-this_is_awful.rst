This is a disheartening thing to read

    As someone who doesn't do a ton of JSON parsing on the command line, I tend to forget `jq <https://jqlang.github.io/jq/manual/>`_ syntax.

    Two tools I really like are `gron <github.com/tomnomnom/gron>`_ (make JSON greppable) from @tomnomnom and `jqp <github.com/noahgorstein/jqp>`_ ..., which provides a "tui playground for exploring jq."

    98% of the time I end up being able to get what I need with gron + grep, then jqp is awesome for when I actually need jq :)

What's so bad?

With Python, all of this "syntax" and "greppable" and "interactive" goes away.

Stop using bash. Start using Python. Life is so much simpler. (And faster. And unit-testable.)
