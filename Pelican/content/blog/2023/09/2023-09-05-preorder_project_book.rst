Want a book with dozens of project ideas?

Each has a description, and approach, and deliverables.
It's a lot like ordinary development work, but with some detailed guidance from the author.
(And no deadline imposed by your team lead or manager.)

These are projects you can do. You can post them GitHub, and make them part of your personal portfolio.
You can demonstrate your ability to code in Python.

The focus is on exploratory data analysis.
This is because almost everything devolves into an exercise in data wrangling.
