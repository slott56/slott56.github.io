Check out DZone's Coding zone: https://dzone.com/coding. Hover over the
"Coding" drop-down menu.

Notice anything lacking?

I'll give you a hint: Python.

They have "Frameworks", "Java", "Javascript", "Languages" and "Tools".

The "Languages" seems to be general programming, and the posts include
Java, JavaScript and numerous other languages.

Let's look at the evidence, shall we?

## Python Trending

Here's some evidence.

- https://statisticstimes.com/tech/top-computer-languages.php

- https://www.infoworld.com/article/3669232/python-popularity-still-soaring.html

- https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/

- https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html

And yes, the last two are summarized by the first one.

The Bottom Line?

Python has grown to be the most popular programming language.
It has edge ahead of Java, C, and C++.

This isn't a new thing. See this from StackOverflow back in 2017.

https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/

Folks looked at the growth curve back in 2017 and concluded the increase in interest
on StackOverflow was due to the language being so hard to
learn and use that lots of people had questions.

A simpler conclusion is lots of people are using it.

And the trend continued for five more years.

## Why?

Why is Python so popular?

1. It's hard to say.

2. It doesn't really matter.

I have some suspicions on why it's so popular.
In his Keynote at PyCon 2017, (https://youtu.be/ZyjCqQEUa8o)
Jake Vanderplas pointed out that scientists can
install Python, install Jupyter Lab, open a notebook,
download data, and start analyzing results immediately.

The whole "getting started" process takes minutes,
and you're doing real science.

As your skills mature, you can write cooler and better-engineered
software.

All in Python.

That's a compelling story.

The other part of it is the response to the growth from publishers and web content providers.

Years ago DZone reliably reposted my blog posts.
It was fun (for me) to get 1,000's of views.
They spent time curating Most Valuable Bloggers.
(https://dzone.com/pages/mvb)

I didn't actively participate because I had a day job
and was writing books, and couldn't do the kinds of
things DZone wanted from content creators.
(It was like taking on *another* book.)

I'm lightly invested in DZone's success in following this
trend. (If I was in the MVB program, I might be more heavily
invested. But I have books to write.)

## DZone Response

The structure of DZone's content leaves me with questions about the basis for the "Zones". It can't be
popularity, since Java has slipped behind Python. Maybe there's some
other criteria; I wonder what they could be? Sponsorships? Or the
historical "Javalobby" web site?

It also leaves me with the urge to suggest they radically rethink their
approach to content management. The "Zones" don't seem to have crisp
definitions. If they do have definitions, it might help to share them.
If they don't have a formal editorial policy on the zones,
perhaps they should be assigned more dynamically as content is reviewed
and included on the site. Perhaps there should be a zoning board?

What's essential here is shfting DZone away from their historically
Java-centric view to embrace Python.

Java can still be a prominent feature, but it needs to be put into
perspective. Python is large, and growing. Java is not quite as large,
and not growing as quickly.

It's time for change.
