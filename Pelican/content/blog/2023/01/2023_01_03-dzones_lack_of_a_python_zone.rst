Check out DZone's Coding zone: https://dzone.com/coding. Hover over the
"Coding" drop-down menu.

Notice anything lacking?

I'll give you a hint: Python.

They have "Frameworks", "Java", "Javascript", "Languages" and "Tools".

The "Languages" seems to be general programming, and the posts include
Java, JavaScript and numerous other languages.

It leaves me with questions about the basis for the "Zones". It can't be
popularity, since Java has slipped behind Python. Maybe there's some
other criteria; I wonder what they could be? Sponsorships? Or the
historical "Javalobby" web site?

It also leaves me with the urge to suggest they radically rethink their
approach to content management. The "Zones" don't seem to have crisp
definitions. If they do, it would help to share them. If they don't,
perhaps they should be assigned more dynamically as content is reviewed
and included on the site.
